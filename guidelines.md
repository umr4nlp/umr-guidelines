##  Part 1. Introduction: What is UMR and what does UMR annotation look like?

The **Uniform Meaning Representation** (UMR) project aims to design a meaning representation that facilitates
the computational interpretation of a text. UMR combines a **sentence-level** representation that is adapted 
from **Abstract Meaning Representation** (AMR), which focuses on **predicate-argument structures**, **word senses**, **named entities**, **multi-word expressions**, **aspect**, and **quantification**, and a document-level representation that focuses on **coreference**, **temporal** and **modal** relations. We illustrate this representation with a short English document as in <a href="#1 (1)">(1)</a> - <a href="#1 (9)">(9)</a>, and then describe in more detail each component of UMR in the next few sections. UMR is intended to be a cross-lingual annotation framework with a shared set of **abstract** concepts and relations. 

Operationally, for both sentence-level and document-level annotation, we assume an annotation procedure in which a document is processed sentence by sentence. The sentence-level representation is annotated first, so that the document-level annotation can make reference to the concepts in the sentence-level representation.

Snt1: Edmund Pope tasted freedom today for the first time in more than eight months.

(t/ taste-01
  :ARG0 (p/ person :wiki "Edmond_Pope"
         :name (n/ name :op1 "Edmund" :op2 "Pope"))
  :ARG1 (f/ free-04
         :ARG1 p)
  :temporal (t2/ today)
  :ord (o/ ordinal-entity :value 1
        :range (m/ more-than
                :op1 (t3/ temporal-quantity :quant 8
                    :unit (m2/ month))))
  :aspect Performance
  :modstr FullAff)
                    
(s1/ sentence
    :temporal((DCT :depends-on s1t2)
	      (s1t2 :contained s1t))
    :modal(AUTH :FullAff s1t))
        
```
The document-level representation includes a list of **temporal and modal dependencies**, as well as a list of **coreference relations**. In this first sentence, the first temporal relation is between *DCT*, a constant that refers to the time when the document is created, and *today*, a concept that can only be correctly interpreted if we know the DCT of the document. In this sense, we say that *today* depends on DCT, hence the relation between them is *:depends-on*. We will define the set of temporal relations used in UMR in [Part 4-2-2](#part-4-2-2-temporal-relations).  The second temporal relation is between *today* and *taste-01*, and we say here *taste-01* happened sometime *today* and therefore is _:contained_ in *today*.

The document-level representation also includes a list of modal dependencies. There is only one modal relation in this sentence, and it is between *taste-01* and *AUTH*. Like DCT, AUTH is also a constant - it refers to the author of this text as a *conceiver*, or in other words, as the *source* of the modal judgment of certainty about the *taste-01* event, which is indicated by the *:FullAff* label.

Snt2: Pope is the American businessman who was convicted last week on spying charges and sentenced to 20 years in a Russian prison.

(i/ identity-91

		 :unit (y/ year)))
	   :ARG3 s
	   :aspect Performance
	   :modstr FullAff)
     :aspect State
     :modstr FullAff)
 
(s2/ sentence
    :temporal((DCT :depends-on s2w)
    	      (s2w :contained s2c)
	      (s2w :contained s2s2)
	      (s2c :before s2s))
    :modal((AUTH :FullAff s2i)
      	   (AUTH :FullAff s2c)
	   (AUTH :FullAff NULL_CHARGER)
	   (NULL_CHARGER :FullAff s2c)
	   (s2c :Unsp s2s)
    :coref(s1p :same-entity s2p))
```
<!-- should annotate coreference for nominals? if so we need to annotate "the american businessman" (the question is really whether it needs to be in the doc graph in addition to the identity-91 predicate in the sent graph)-->

For this sentence, the temporal relations represent the fact that the *conviction* event and the *sentence* event both
happened *last week*, which itself depends on the DCT for its temporal interpretation, and that the *sentence* event happened after the *conviction*. The modal dependencies indicate that from the author's perspective, the *conviction* event and the
*sentence* event definitely happened, and that *Pope* is certainly *the American businessman*. It introduces a *NULL_CHARGER* conceiver to indicate that the authority that charged Pope (which is not explicit in the text) presents the *spying* event as a certainty. The coreference annotation specifies that *Pope* in sentence 2 and *Edmund Pope* in sentence 1 are the same entity.

Snt3: He denied any wrongdoing.

      :ARG1 (t/ thing
            :ARG1-of (d2/ do-02
                  :ARG0 p
                  :ARG1-of (w/ wrong-02)
		  :modpred d))
      :aspect Performance
      :modstr FullAff)
  
(s3/ sentence
    :temporal((DCT :before s3d)
              (s3d :before s3d2))
    :modal((AUTH :FullAff s3d)
    	   (AUTH :FullAff s3p)
           (s3p :FullNeg s3d2)
	   (s3d :Unsp s3d2))
    :coref(s2p :same-entity s3p))

```

For this sentence, the coreference annotation indicates that *he* is the same person as *Pope* mentioned in <a href="#1 (2)">(2)</a>. Because there is no strict event coreference or subevent relation between *wrongdoing* and, for example, *spying* in  <a href="#1 (2)">(2)</a>, this relation is left unannotated.

The temporal annotation indicates that Pope's denial took place before document creation time, and that any *wrongdoing* would have happened before this denial. When annotating temporal relations, we always need to pick a *reference time* with respect to which the temporal relation between the reference time and the event can be determined. In this case, it is not clear whether the *deny* event happened before or after the *conviction* and *sentence* events, so the reference time is determined to be the document creation time.

The modal relations indicate that the *deny* event definitely happened according to the author. The author presents themselves as having certainty about Pope's mental state at the time of the denial (annotated as a :FullAff relation from AUTH to *Pope*), and the :FullNeg relation indicates that *wrongdoing* did not happen according to Edmund Pope, based on the author's account.

Snt4: Russian President Vladimir Putin pardoned him for health reasons.
(p/ pardon-01

                        :name (n2/ name :op1 "Russia"))
                  :ARG3 (p3/ president)))
      :ARG1 (p4/ person
      	    :ref-person 3rd
	    :ref-number Singular)
      :ARG1-of (c2/ cause-01
            :ARG0 (r/ reason

      :aspect Performance

(s4/ sentence
    :temporal(s2s2 :after s4p)
    :modal (AUTH :FullAff s4p)
    :coref(s3p :same-entity s4p4))
```

In the document-level representation for this sentence, the person that is pardoned by Putin is marked as coreferential with *he* in sentence 3 (and therefore *Edmund Pope*). In the temporal annotation, the *sentence-01* event is designated as the reference time of *pardon-01* - the latter happens after the former. In the modal annotation, *pardon-01* is annotated as certain from the point of view of the author.

Snt5: Pope was flown to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany.

(s5/ sentence
    :temporal(s4p :after s5f)
    :modal(AUTH :FullAff s5f)
    :coref(s4p4 :same-entity s5p))
```
In the document-level annotation of this sentence, *pardon-01* from <a href="#1 (4)">(4)</a> is chosen as the
reference time of the *fly-01* event, and it happened before the *fly-01* event. The author is certain that the *fly-01* 
event happened, and *Pope* in this sentence is the same person as *him* in the previous one.

Snt6: He will spend the next several days at the medical center there before he returns home with his wife Sherry

         (AUTH :FullAff s6r))
  :coref((s5p :same-entity s6p)
         (s5b :same-entity s6t2))
```
In the temporal annotation of this sentence, the DCT is chosen as the reference time for *spend-02*, which is in turn the reference time for *return-01* - *spending time at the medical center* will happen after the DCT, and *returning home* will happen later still. In the modality annotation, both *spend-02* and and *return-01* are presented by the author as certainly happening - or at least as certain as one can be about future events. In the coreference annotation, *he* is considered to be the same as the *person* whose name is Pope in <a href="#1 (5)">(5)</a>, and *there* is the same location as the town of *Ramstein, Germany* in the preceding sentence.

  :coref (s6p :same-entity s7p))
```
For <a href="#1 (7)">(7)</a>, the state of being in *remission-02* held simultaneously with the *arrest-01* event, and the *arrest-01* event happended before the *convict-01* event from sentence 2. According to the author, both *arrest-01* and *be in remission* happened. Once again, *Pope* is the same entity as *he* in the previous sentence.

##  Part 2. From AMR to UMR

### Part 2-1. Introduction

UMR inherits the sentence-level representation of AMR, with modifications. Like AMR, the sentence-level representation of UMR is a single-rooted, directed, node- and edge-labeled graph, as in <a href="#2 (1)">(1)</a>. The nodes of this graph are UMR concepts, while edges represent UMR relations. 

<span id="2 (1)">2 (1)</span>

  :aspect Performance
  :modstr FullAff)
```

**UMR concepts:** There are a number of ways that UMR concepts are created based on the input sentence:

* Lemmas: Some UMR concepts are simply lemmas. For example, `today` in the example above is a lemma, which happens to have the same form as the word token itself.
* Word senses: When definitions of word senses are available for a language in the form of a lexicon, a concept can also be a sense-disambiguated word. For instance, `taste-01` in the example above refers to the first sense of the word *taste* in the English PropBank.
* Concepts formed out of multi-word expressions: `more-than` is a concept that is formed by concatenating multiple words in a sentence. Exactly when 
mulit-word concepts should be formed will be determined on a language-by-language basis.
* Named entity types. Named entities in a sentence are annotated with a named entity type concept (e.g., `person`) and a `name` concept. The actual names are annotated as a constant (`Edmund` and `Pope`).
* Abstract concepts. In some cases a concept can be inferred from the context. In this case, the concept does not correspond to any particular word in the sentence, hence it is an *abstract* concept (e.g. `ordinal-entity`).

**UMR relations:** There are also a number of ways relations between concepts are created:

* Participant roles: The participant roles characterize the role that a participant plays with respect to the predicate. They can be predicate-specific if a set of *frame files* are defined for a language, where a set of core participant roles are defined for each (sense of the) predicate. For example, `:ARG0` and `:ARG1` are participant roles defined for `taste-01`. For languages that do not have *frame files*, the participant roles are generic (e.g., `Actor`, `Experiencer`), and they are described in [Part 3-2-1](#part-3-2-1-participant-roles).
* Semantic relations: Other UMR relations include `:temporal`, `:ord`, `:range` etc. that are not normally characterized as participant roles. A complete list of such relations can be found in [Part 3-2-2](#part-3-2-2-Non-participant-role-UMR-relations).

**UMR attributes:** UMR currently has seven attribute types:

* Aspect: Aspect is annotated for eventive concepts only (see
[Part 3-1-1](#part-3-1-1-eventive-concepts) on event identification). Possible Aspect values at the default level of granularity include `Activity`, `Habitual`, `State`, `Endeavor`, `Performance`. A complete list of aspect values with explanations and examples can be found in [Part 3-3-1](#part-3-3-1-aspect). 
* Polarity: Polarity is only annotated for negative polarity as indicated by a negation marker or an affix indicating negation (see [Part 3-3-3](#part-3-3-3-polarity)).
* Mode: The mode attribute is typically for the main predicate of a sentence. Its values include `imperative`, `expressive`, and `interrogative` (see [Part 3-3-2](#part-3-3-2-mode)).
* Quantity: The value of a `:quant` attribute is a numerical number (see [Part 3-3-4](#part-3-3-4-quant)).
* Value: The value of a `:value` attribute is a numerical number (see [Part 3-2-2](#part-3-2-2-Non-participant-role-UMR-relations)).
* Degree: The value of a `:degree` attribute is either `intensifier`, `downtoner`, or `equal` (see [Part 3-3-6](#part-3-3-6-degree)).
* Reference: The value of a `:ref-person` or `:ref-number` attribute is a either a person feature (e.g. `1st`, `2nd`, `3rd`) or a number feature (e.g. `Singular`, `Dual`, `Paucal`, `Plural`) used to represent reference. These features are used to represent pronouns, verbal cross-referencing, implicit arguments, and overt nominal number (see [Part 3-3-5](#part-3-3-5-ref)).

**UMR modal values:** UMR currently has three modal relations that are annotated at the sentence level, even though the final modal dependency structure functions at the document level:

* Modstr: Indicates the epistemic strength relation (degree of confidence/certainty) between a conceiver and an event or between a conceiver and an embedded conceiver.
* Modpred: Indicates the relation between a modal complement-taking predicate and its complement
* Quot: Indicates the relation between a speech predicate and its complement

**Differences between AMR and UMR**

UMR differs from AMR in a number of ways:

* UMR has a document-level representation that represents *coreference*, *temporal dependencies*, and *modal dependencies*.

* As a result, some sentence-level AMR concepts  are now represented at the document level. This applies to concepts for modality (e.g., `possible-01`, `obligate-01`) - see the AMR and the UMR for *The boy can go* in <a href="#2 (2a)">(2a)</a> and <a href="#2 (2b)">(2b)</a>, respectively.

<span id="2 (2a)">2 (2a)</span>

```

   :ARG0 (g/ go-01  
            :ARG0 (b/ boy

```

    	:ref-number Singular)
    :aspect State
    :modstr NeutAff)

(s0/sentence
  :modal (AUTH :NEUT s0g))
  
```

* UMR adds a *scope* concept to represent the relative scope of quantifiers and negations. See [Part-3-1-5](#part-3-1-5-scope-for-quantification-and-negation) for details.
* UMR allows the use of non-predicate-specific participant roles for languages that do not have *frame files* with lexicalized argument structure information. See [Part 3-2-1](#part-3-2-1-participant-roles) for details. To further accomodate languages with less advanced grammatical description or resource availability, other annotation domains are structured as *lattices*.
* UMR adds *aspect* and *ref* attributes to the representation. See [Part 3-3-1](#part-3-3-1-aspect) and [Part 3-3-5](#part-3-3-5-ref) for details.

### Part 2-2. Introduction for field linguists

The annotation scheme detailed in these guidelines, Uniform Meaning
Representation (UMR), intends to allow for annotation of temporal,
aspectual, modal, and quantification semantics, as well as semantic
argument structure, in a cross-linguistically motivated and portable
way. Some semantic domains, specifically coreference, temporal
relations, and modal relations, are annotated in a document-level
structure. Other domains, such as predicate-argument structure, aspect,
and quantification, are annotated in a sentence-level structure.

This UMR sentence-level structure builds on a sentence-level representation
that is adapted from the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)
annotation scheme, which was originally designed for the annotation of
English, and has since been extended to Chinese and Arabic, amongst
others. This means that, before getting to the cross-linguistically
motivated parts of UMR annotation, annotators for new languages need to
do some AMR-based annotation of their texts, specifically regarding
predicate-argument structure. This section of the guidelines discusses
which parts of AMR annotation are required before the UMR annotation
procedure detailed in the rest of these guidelines can be applied.

The core of AMR is that it represents natural language sentences as
single-rooted, directed, node-labelled and edge-labelled graphs.
Semantic concepts expressed in such natural language sentences are
represented in two ways. Some of them are represented as *concepts*,
which means that they function as nodes in the AMR graphs. This is the
case for predicates and (heads of) referring expressions, for instance.
Other meanings are represented as *relations* in AMR, which means that
they function as edges in the AMR graphs. This is the case for argument
roles and a range of different modification relations, amongst others.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

#### Part 2-2-1. Predicate-argument relations

The annotation of predicate-argument structure is the main domain in
which AMR annotation conventions are inherited. First and foremost,
predicated events are represented in the graph as nodes, as are
predicated states, events that are being referred to or used as
modifiers, and various other kinds of "non-verbal predicates" (see
[Part 3-1-1](#part-3-1-1-eventive-concepts) on event identification). For annotation of English texts,
sense-disambiguated predicates from PropBank, such as the one presented below for English _taste_ are used to label predicate
nodes. Since for most languages, no equivalent of PropBank is available, the UMR annotation tool contains a lexicon-building functionality where annotators can either upload a lexicon created in FLEx to support them in their annotation effort, or they can start a lexicon with argument structure information from scratch and essentially build PropBank-style frame files on the fly.

```
Roleset id: taste.01, use one's tastebuds, active perception of flavor.
Roles:
	ARG0: taster
	ARG1: food
	
Roleset id: taste.02, possess a flavor.
Roles
	ARG1: thing with flavor
	ARG2: description of flavor
```

The semantic arguments of such predicate nodes are represented in the
graph as daughter nodes of the relevant predicate. The edge that connects parent and daughter
nodes in these structures carries a participant role label. For English,
these participant role labels are predicate-specific, numbered argument
roles drawn once again from PropBank. For languages without comparable
lexical databases, we use an inventory of general argument roles such as
`:actor`, `:undergoer`, and `:theme`. In the long run, annotations can be used to
create language-specific and predicate-specific frame files detailing
argument structure of individual predicates, and the predicate-specific
argument roles can be linked to predicate-general participant roles for
commensurability (see [Part 3-2-1](#part-3-2-1-participant-roles) on argument structure annotation).
This AMR-based predicate-argument annotation is shown in its most basic
form in <a href="#2-2-1 (1)">(1)</a> from Sanapaná (Enlhet-Enenlhet) below.

<span id="2-2-1 (1)">2-2-1 (1)</span>
```
ap-hle-am-ke'		nenhlet
2/3M-travel-TI-DECL	person
'A man travelled.'

(e/ enhleama-00 'travel'
	:actor (n/ nenhlet 'person'
		:ref-number Singular)
	:aspect Endeavor
	:modstr FullAff)
(t/ travel-01
	:ARG0 (m/ man
		:ref-number Singular)
	:aspect Endeavor
	:modstr FullAff)
```

The basic, AMR-inspired graph structures for simple sentences in
languages like English and Sanapaná then look very similar, as shown
above: they both have a predicate corresponding to the main event of the
sentence as the top of the graph - the English one has a reference to a
numbered PropBank frame file for the predicate *travel*, the Sanapaná
one just has the citation form of the *travel*-verb with a `-00` suffix.
In both cases, the semantic argument 'person/man' is a daughter of this
predicate, linked with a participant role edge. In English, this is a
numbered participant role taken from this same PropBank frame file,
while in Sanapaná it is a predicate-general participant role. In both languages, the participant has a :ref-number Singular attribute.

AMR and UMR concepts are underspecified for morphosyntactic
representation: the same concept (for example, `travel-01`) can be used
to annotate a verb (as seen above), a noun (e.g. *his travels* in <a href="#2-2-1 (2)">(2)</a>, or any other relevant part of speech conveying the same semantics. [Part 3-1-1](#part-3-1-1-eventive-concepts) discusses how AMR and UMR deal with the
information-packaging differences which are conveyed by packaging such
content in different parts of speech.

#### Part 2-2-2. Multi-word expressions

UMR inherits annotation conventions from AMR in domains other than
predicate-argument structure. With regard to concepts, UMR treats
multi-word expressions in essentially the same way as AMR. Specifically,
it allows annotators to select multiple words in a sentence and annotate
them as a single concept. This is necessary, for example, to annotate
idiomatic expressions which cannot be semantically decomposed
felicitously. In <a href="#2-2-2 (1)">(1)</a> from Sanapaná, for instance,
*elvongkeskama tayep* is a multi-word expression which literally and
compositionally means 'cause (someone) to be just across', but its
idiomatic meaning is 'rescue'. The two words are therefore annotated
together as a multi-word expression with a single meaning. Some further
specifications are made in UMR with regards to the annotation of
multi-word expressions such as serial verb constructions and
periphrastic TAM constructions. More information about the annotation of
multi-word expressions is given throughout [Part 3-1-3](#part-3-1-3-concept-word-mismatches), and
specifically in section [Part 3-1-3-6](#part-3-1-3-6-multi-word-concepts).

		:ref-number Plural)
	:aspect Performance
	:modstr FullAff)
```
[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

#### Part 2-2-3. Abstract concepts

AMR conventions are also largely inherited with regards to the use of
abstract concepts. Abstract concepts are concepts that are identified
and annotated even though they do not (consistently) correspond to any
overt word in the sentence. There are typically two main reasons for
which AMR and UMR use abstract concepts. Firstly, there are concepts
where AMR and UMR use abstract concepts rather than language-specific
concepts corresponding to specific words with the goal of making
annotations cross-linguistically comparable. For example, even though
the Sanapaná thetic possession construction in <a href="#2-2-3 (1)">(1)</a> makes use of a verb
that literally means *exist*, an abstract concept predicate node
`have-91` is introduced rather than a language specific `enyetnema-00`
concept. This way, possessive constructions across the world's languages
can be annotated in consistent and comparable ways regardless of the
morphosyntactic strategies they use (see [Part 3-1-3-6](#Part-3-1-3-6-Non-verbal-clauses) for more
information on such "non-verbal clauses").

<span id="2-2-3 (1)">2-2-3 (1)</span>
```

	:ARG1 (p/ person
		:ref-person 1st
		:ref-number Singular)
	:ARG2 (v/ vakkahak 'book')
	:aspect State
	:modstr FullAff)
```

Secondly, abstract concept conventions are inherited from AMR in a
variety of domains where information expressed in natural language text
needs to be standardized for computational tractability. This applies
to, for example, the annotation of different types of quantities (which
use abstract concepts such as `distance-quantity`,
`temporal-quantity` and `monetary-quantity`, as
illustrated in <a href="#2-2-3 (2a)">(2a)</a>-<a href="#2-2-3 (2b)">(2b)</a>, and the annotation of dates and times (which use abstract concepts such as `date-entity`, as illustrated in <a href="#2-2-3 (2c)">(2c)</a>, all from Sanapaná). More information on abstract concepts can be found throughout this document in the sections dedicated to the specific semantic phenomena for which they are needed.

#### Part 2-2-4. Non-participant role relations

Another domain in which AMR conventions are inherited by UMR is the
annotation of non-participant role relations. Such relations are used to
annotate a wide range of meanings. Many of them, such as `:medium`,
`:topic`, and `:mod` (the latter of which is illustrated in <a href="#2-2-3 (2b)">(2-2-3 2b)</a> are used to
annotate modifiers of referring expressions. Other relations are used
with specific abstract concepts: whenever a `date-entity`
concept is present, one of the temporal relations `:month`, `:year`, `:day`
etc. will be used, for example. The use of these relations is treated
more in detail in [Part 3-2-2](#part-3-2-2-Non-participant-role-UMR-relations) of this document.

Even though many of these relations are straightforwardly inherited by
UMR, some changes are made to their use for the sake of cross-linguistic
comparability. Firstly, UMR adjusts the use of the `:mod` relation to
cover all *typifying* modifiers - i.e. modifiers which subcategorize the
reference of a referring expression rather than narrowing it down to a
specific entity (e.g. *women* in *women's magazine*). In AMR, this
semantic domain was shared between the `:mod` relation and a number of
other relations such as `:medium`, `:topic`, and `:group`. In UMR, these
other relations still exist, but they are treated as more fine-grained
values on a lattice underneath the more general `:mod` relation. Whereas
AMR used the `:frequency` and `:duration` relations as the main ways of
annotating aspect, UMR does this through a dedicated `:aspect` attribute.
However, UMR maintains the `:duration` and `:frequency` relations so that
annotators can use them to indicate more fine-grained aspectual
information beyond the aspect categories offered in the corresponding
attribute, as in <a href="#2-2-3 (2b)">(2-2-3 2b)</a>. UMR also adds a new non-participant role relation: the `:other-role` relation, which annotators can use when encountering meanings that UMR currently does not provide a straightforward annotation procedure for.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

#### Part 2-2-5. Attributes

The last area in which AMR conventions are inherited by UMR is that of
*attribute* annotations. Attributes are relations which attach one of a
closed, pre-defined list of values to a concept node: for example, the
`:aspect` attribute allows annotators to hang a `State`, `Habitual`,
`Activity`, `Endeavor`, or `Performance` value off
of a predicate node.

Attributes inherited from AMR are `:polarity`, `:mode`,
`:quant`, and `:value` ([Part 3-2-2](#part-3-2-2-Non-participant-role-UMR-relations), [Part 3-3](#part-3-3-UMR-attributes)). The use
of the `:quant` relation was changed in that a more fine-grained
annotation scheme for quantification is now available (see [Part 3-1-5](#part-3-1-5-scope-for-quantification-and-negation), [Part 3-3-4](#part-3-3-4-quant)). The `:quant` relation is mainly what annotators with
less training or for languages with less available linguistic analysis
will use to flag concepts that are of interest with regards to
quantification. More confident annotators
and annotators for well-documented languages will apply the full
fine-grained quantification and scope scheme. One
specific change is that, whereas in mensural constructions (e.g. *three
cups of milk*), AMR varies between having the substance or the mensural
term as the head depending on morphosyntactic expression, UMR always
annotates the substance as the head for greater cross-linguistic
comparability. This means that even less conventionalized measure terms,
like English *cup* or *bag*, are annotated as modifiers, even though
they look like morphosyntactic heads. This is illustrated in <a href="#2-2-5 (1)">(1)</a>. The use of the `:polarity` value is constrained to the sentence level.
Propositional negation is annotated in the modal section of the document
level annotation and through `:modstr` relations. The `:polarity` value is used to indicate any overt
morphosyntactic exponents of negation at the sentence level, flagging
such concepts as interesting for the modal or scope negation. This
includes e.g. morphologically negated adjectives like _unhappy_, even though in the
document-level modal annotation, these will not be annotated as negated.

<span id="2-2-5 (1)">2-2-5 (1)</span>
```
Three bottles of water
(w/ water
	:quant 3
	:unit (b/ bottle))
```

UMR introduces four new attributes: `:aspect` (see [Part 3-3-1](#part-3-3-1-Aspect)), `:degree` (see [Part 3-3-6](#part-3-3-6-degree)), and
`:ref-person` and `:ref-number` (see [Part 3-3-5](#part-3-3-5-ref)).

#### Part 3-1-1. Eventive concepts

Identification of eventive concepts is important to participant role annotation as well as aspect and modality annotation.
The criteria used to identify events in UMR are largely based on the
criteria used in TimeML (Pustejovsky et al. 2005). Event identification is not based on parts of speech or word classes, since these vary greatly across languages. Instead, event identification is based on a combination of semantic type and information packaging (Croft 2001). Semantic type refers to the difference between entities (or, objects), states (or, properties), and processes; this can be thought of as a categorization of things in the real world.
Information packaging (also called discourse function or information
structure), on the other hand, characterizes how a particular linguistic
expression “packages” the semantic content. There are three fundamental
information packaging functions: reference, modification, and
predication. Croft (2022)  defines them as:

**reference**: what the speaker is talking about  
**modification**: additional information provided about the referent  
**predication**: what the speaker is asserting about the referents in a particular utterance

The three semantic types can occur with any of the three fundamental
information packaging functions, as shown in Table
1 from Croft (2022).


<div id="tab:information_packaging">

|           |              Reference               |           Modification           |         Predication         |
| :-------: | :----------------------------------: | :------------------------------: | :-------------------------: |
| Entities  |         the sharp **thorns**         |      the **bush’s** thorns       |     It **is a thorn.**      |
|  States   |            **sharpness**             |       the **sharp** thorns       | Those thorns **are sharp.** |
|     Processes      |     I said \[**that** the thorns **scratched** me\]. / <br />      the \[**scratching** of the thorns\]    |       the thorns **that** \[**scratched** me\] / <br /> the thorns \[**scratching** me\]        |      The sharp thorns **scratched** me.      |

Table 1: Semantic types expressed in different information packaging constructions
</div>

Cross-linguistically, certain types of morphosyntactic constructions
tend to express specific combinations of semantic type and information
packaging; these are shown in Table 2,
modified from Croft (2001). Prototypical combinations of semantic type and
information packaging are indicated with caps. These correspond to
well-known part-of-speech classes across languages: entities in
reference correspond to nouns, states in modification to adjectives, and
processes in predication to verbs.

<div id="tab:eventive_concepts">

Table 2: Constructions identified as events
</div>

The most prototypical expression for an event is a process in
predication, therefore we identify a word/phrase as an event if it has
either the semantic type of the prototype (process) or the prototypical
information packaging (predication). The categories which are identified
as events in UMR are shown in bold in Table 2.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

##### Part 3-1-1-1. Processes in predication

Predicated processes are the most prototypical subcategory of events,
corresponding cross-linguistically to unmarked verbs. They will
therefore always be identified as events. This is shown in
<a href="#3-1-1-1 (1)">(1)</a> below. (Throughout this section, words
that are identified as events will be shown in bold; the relevant
phenomenon under discussion will be italicized.)

<span id="3-1-1-1 (1)">3-1-1-1 (1)</span>

<span id="3-1-1-1 (1a)">(1a)</span> She
<u>**_repaired_**</u> her bike.  
<span id="3-1-1-1 (1b)">(1b)</span> Before
she <u>**_went_**</u> to school, she **repaired** my bike.  

Regardless of whether they are in an independent clause, like *repaired*
in <a href="#3-1-1-1 (1a)">(1a)</a>, or a dependent clause, like *went* in
<a href="#3-1-1-1 (1b)">(1b)</a>, predicated processes are always
identified as events.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

##### Part 3-1-1-2. Processes in modification and reference

Processes packaged as modifiers or referents should also be identified
as events. Cross-linguistically, these may take a variety of
morphosyntactic forms, such as event nominals (as in
<a href="#3-1-1-2 (1a)">(1a)</a>), non-finite complements (as in
<a href="#3-1-1-2 (1b)">(1b)</a>), participles (as in
<a href="#3-1-1-2 (1c)">(1c)</a>), or relative clauses (as in
<a href="#3-1-1-2 (1d)">(1d)</a>).

<span id="3-1-1-2 (1)">3-1-1-2 (1)</span>

<span id="3-1-1-2 (1a)">3-1-1-2 (1a)</span> The
**<u>_storm_</u> damaged** the roads.

<span id="3-1-1-2 (1b)">3-1-1-2 (1b)</span> She
**wanted <u>_to go_</u>** to school.

<span id="3-1-1-2 (1c)">3-1-1-2 (1c)</span> The
student **<u>_playing_</u>** the violin **likes** Bach.

<span id="3-1-1-2 (1d)">3-1-1-2 (1d)</span> The student,
who is **<u>_playing_</u>** the violin, **likes** Bach.

The combination of semantic type and information packaging determines
whether or not a particular word in a particular context is identified
as an event. The morphological structure of a word (i.e., whether or not
it derives from a verb) doesn’t factor into whether or not it is
identified as an event. For example, not all event nominals are derived
from verbs, as in <a href="#3-1-1-2 (2a)">(2a)</a>; and, not all words
derived from verbs actually refer to processes, as in
<a href="#3-1-1-2 (2b)">(2b)</a>.

<span id="3-1-1-2 (2)">3-1-1-2 (2)</span>

<span id="3-1-1-2 (2a)">3-1-1-2 (2a)</span> He is
**planning** a **<u>_ceremony_</u>** for Saturday.

<span id="3-1-1-2 (2b)">3-1-1-2 (2b)</span>
The bus <u>_driver_</u> **turned** the corner too sharply.

Even the same lexical item may or may not refer to a process, depending
on context as in <a href="#3-1-1-2 (3)">(3)</a> below.

<span id="3-1-1-2 (3)">3-1-1-2 (3)</span>

<span id="3-1-1-2 (3a)">3-1-1-2 (3a)</span>

The <u>**_final exam_**</u> began at 8:00.

<span id="3-1-1-2 (3b)">3-1-1-2 (3b)</span>

One student **threw** their <u>_final exam_</u> in the trash.

In <a href="#3-1-1-2 (3a)">(3a)</a>, *final exam* refers to a process and therefore
is identified as an event. In <a href="#3-1-1-2 (3b)">(3b)</a>, however,
*final exam* refers to a physical object and therefore is not identified
as an event.

Participles (or other non-finite verb forms) are identified as events,
unless they are part of a compound. For example, *floating* in *floating
hospitals* is identified as an event, but *firing* in *firing squad* is
not, since it is part of a compound. One way to check for this
distinction is to see if the event described by the participle must be
ongoing at the reference time. For example, one can say *I saw the
firing squad* without having seen an actual firing event, whereas *I saw
the floating hospitals* implies that the seer witnessed the floating
event as well.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

##### Part 3-1-1-3. States and entities

As mentioned above, anything that is predicated is identified as an
event, even if it is not a process. Two-place statives, such as *love*
in <a href="#3-1-1-3 (1)">(1)</a>, are annotated in the same way as predicated
processes, i.e. an event is identified and labelled with the predicate
in the language.

<span id="3-1-1-3 (1)">3-1-1-3 (1)</span>

My cat <u>**_loves_**</u> wet food.

Other types of predicated states and entities require different
solutions based on their function and the strategy used to express them
in a language; we call these “non-verbal clauses”. The different
functional types of non-verbal clauses are shown below in Table 3.

<div id="tab:nonverbaltypes">

| **Semantics** | **Information-packaging** | **Example**                     |
| :------------ | :------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| possession    | thetic/presentational     | The teacher has a dog.          |
| possession    | predicational             | The dog is the teacher's.       |
| location      | thetic/presentational     | On the rock was a symbol.       |
| location      | predicational             | The symbol was on the rock.     |
| property      | predicational             | The cat is black.               |
| object        | predicational             | Panda is a cat.                 |
| object        | equational                | Panda is my cat.                |

Table 3: Non-verbal clause types
</div>

There are four semantic types of non-verbal clauses: possession,
location, property, and object. All of these occur with predicational
information-packaging: the possessive relationship, location, property,
or object category are predicated of the possession or theme. Possession and location are, in addition, used in a context in which the entire information is presented as ‘thetic’ or ‘all-new’ in the terms of
Lambrecht’s theory of information structure (Lambrecht 1994; cf. the contrast between
‘have’ possession \[thetic\] and ‘belong’ possession \[predicational\]
in Heine 1997). One common thetic function is presentational, as in the examples
in Table 3 above. For objects, it can be
difficult to distinguish equational (corresponding to Lambrecht’s
identificational information structure) and predicational
information-packaging in context (see Stassen 1997:106-111). Object predication asserts that
the theme is part of a category of objects (i.e., *Panda* fits within
the category of *cat*), whereas equational sentences indicate that two
referents are the same (i.e., *Panda* is the same referent as *my cat*).

For these non-verbal clause categories, the event identified is labelled
with a special abstract UMR predicate that indicates the relevant combination of
semantics and information-packaging. These are shown below in Table 4. Note that some of these (e.g. `have-91`, `belong-91`) look very similar to existing English PropBank predicates (`have-03` and `belong-01`, respectively). However, they are cross-linguistic abstract concepts meant to annotate the crosslinguistically stable meanings of thetic possession and predicative possession, respectively. For the labelling of participants with these
non-verbal clause predicates, see [Part 3-2-1-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-1-non-verbal-clauses).

##### Part 3-1-1-4. Implicit events

Since UMR annotates meaning, and not form, there are situations where
events are identified in the absence of explicit linguistic material.
These correspond to events which are implicit, given the context, but
not overtly expressed. We encourage annotators to be conservative on
this front; when in doubt, don’t add an implicit event.

We’ve identified two types implicit events: those where the implicit
event corresponds to an event mentioned earlier in the text (as in
<a href="#3-1-1-4 (1)">(1)</a>), and those where it does not (as in
<a href="#3-1-1-4 (2)">(2)</a>).

<span id="3-1-1-4 (1)">3-1-1-4 (1)</span>

<span id="3-1-1-4 (1a)">3-1-1-4 (1a)</span> John was **smoking** on
the corner of the street, but when he **saw** me, he stopped <u>
**\[_smoking_\]**</u>.

<span id="3-1-1-4 (1b)">3-1-1-4 (1b)</span> They **told** me “a card
was **left** on Tuesday” (no it wasn’t <u>**\[_left_\]**</u> of
course)...

In <a href="#3-1-1-4 (1a)">(1a)</a>, there is an implicit second *smoking* event and
in <a href="#3-1-1-4 (1b)">(1b)</a>, there is an implicit second *leave* event. These
implicit events should be annotated as coreferential with the event
mentioned earlier in the text (see [Part 4-1](#part-4-1-coreference)).

In <a href="#3-1-1-4 (2)">(2)</a>, however, the implicit events don’t
have a relationship with an event previously mentioned in the text;
instead, they refer to generic events which can be filled in from
context.

<span id="3-1-1-4 (2)">3-1-1-4 (2)</span>

<span id="3-1-1-4 (2a)">3-1-1-4 (2a)</span> **Phoned** Amtrak on
Wednesday, <u>**\[_they said_\]**</u> “We **need** a consignment
number”.

<span id="3-1-1-4 (2b)">3-1-1-4 (2b)</span> “I have **ordered** the Coast
Guard and our entire naval force in the (Central Philippines) region
<u>**\[_to go_\]**</u> to the area,” she **said**.

In <a href="#3-1-1-4 (2a)">(2a)</a>, the quotation marks make it clear that there is an
implicit *say* event. In <a href="#3-1-1-4 (2b)">(2b)</a>, we can identify a very general
*go* event, since *ordered...to the area* implies a motion event. For
these types of implicit events, the most abstract, least specific event
should be identified. For example in <a href="#3-1-1-4 (2b)">(2b)</a>, we could make an
assumption based on context clues (e.g., *Coast Guard, naval force*),
that the type of motion event is *sail*. But, that assumption may not be
accurate (and may not be shared amongst annotators); therefore, the most
general event possible should be identified.

 #### Part 3-1-2. Named entities
 
Following AMR, each named entity in a text is annotated with a type. However, the vocabuary of the named entity types are adapted from AMR so that they reflect the characterization of additional languages and thus made uniform across languages. Example <a href="#3-1-2 (1)">(1)</a> has a `nationality` entity and a `person` entity. 

<span id="3-1-2 (1)">3-1-2 (1)</span> Edmond Pope is an American businessman.
```
(h/ have-role-91
      :ARG1 (p/ person :wiki "Edmond_Pope"
            :name (n/ name :op1 "Edmund" :op2 "Pope"))
      :ARG3 (b/ businessman
      	    :mod (n2/ nationality :wiki "United_States"
	          :name (n3/ name :op1 "America")))
      :aspect State
      :modstr FullAff)         
```        
The total set of entity types are hierarchically organized, as listed in Table 5 below.

 #### Part 3-1-3. Concept-word mismatches
 
Cross-linguistically, concepts are not always mapped onto words in the
same way. Many low-resource languages are morphologically more complex
than languages like English, and they often express in a single word
concepts for which English needs multiple words. For a number of
reasons, UMR does not require the decomposition of morphologically
complex words into morphemes that individually map to concepts, but
instead, such words can as a whole map to multiple concepts. How exactly
this mapping between single, (often) morphologically complex words and
multiple concepts is achieved depends on which semantic categories are
involved and how they behave across languages. This section provides
guidance on the annotation of predicates and arguments in five different
types of constructions where the mapping between words and concepts is
not straightforward.

 ##### Part 3-1-3-1. Predicate and argument as one word

In languages that make use of verbal argument indexation (i.e.
pronominal affixes on the verb to cross-reference semantic arguments) or
noun incorporation, predicates and their arguments can be expressed
together in a single word. Both issues are illustrated in 
<a href="#3-1-3-1 (1)">(1)</a> from Arapaho. Here, what is
expressed as a multi-word sentence in the English translation takes the
form of a single Arapaho word. The pronominal suffix *-o'* indicates
that a first person argument acts on a third person argument. The
lexical item for 'head', *e'ei*, is incorporated in the verb, and the
classifier *-s* indicates that the instrument is a blade-like implement.
So, this single word expresses the predicate, and the actor, undergoer,
theme, and instrument arguments of this state of affairs.

<span id="3-1-3-1 (1)">3-1-3-1 (1)</span>
```
nih-teb-e'ei-s-o'
PST-break/remove.stick.like-head-by.blade.CAUS-1SG/3SG
'I cut his head off with a knife.'
(t/ teb-e'ei-s ‘break/remove.stick.like’
    :actor (p/ person
    	:ref-person 1st
	:ref-number Singular)
    :undergoer (p2/ person
    	:ref-person 3rd
	:ref-number Singular)
    :theme (t2/ thing
    	:ref-person Obviative)
    :aspect Performance
    :modstr FullAff)
```

When languages use verbal affixes to index arguments, these arguments
then may or may not be expressed through independent NPs elsewhere in
the clause. UMR treats such indexed arguments in the same way as it does
free pronouns - they are identified as arguments of the verb. So, even
though there is no overt word in the sentence above referring to a first
person actor or a third person undergoer, these arguments are
nevertheless identified and annotated (using a named-entity concept, in
this case `person` or `thing`), as they are clearly identifiable to
native speakers of the language.

Noun incorporation constructions come in different types across
languages (Mithun 1984). Some constructions, such as the one illustrated by *-e'ei*
'head' above, are not very grammaticalized. Here, the incorporated noun
functions as an argument of the verb, meaning that no overt NP can be
present in the clause to fill this semantic role. So, while UMR treats
the whole stem *teb-e'ei-s* as the predicate, it also identifies a
separate concept for 'head', which has the `:theme` participant role as
seen in the UMR corresponding to example
<a href="#3-1-3-1 (1)">(1)</a>.

On the other hand, in more grammaticalized noun incorporation
constructions, the incorporated noun does not "replace" one of the
verbal arguments. Instead, the incorporated noun only denotes a very
general class of objects, and an independent NP can be present in the
clause to specify the kind of object at hand. Such noun incorporation
constructions are often referred to as "verbal classifiers". For
example, the Arapaho instrumental suffix *-s* indicates that the
"remove"-event is done by means of a blade-like implement, but still an
independent NP can appear to specify the instrument. For such
grammaticalized noun incorporation constructions, no separate concept
corresponding to the incorporated noun is identified. A participant
with the `:instrument` role is only identified if it is expressed as an
overt NP in the clause.

This treatment of noun incorporation means that a certain amount of
linguistic analysis must be done prior to UMR annotation. If the
language at hand has one or more noun incorporation constructions,
annotators need to know for any individual construction whether or not
it allows the expression of the incorporated participant as an
independent overt NP. Of course, grammaticalization is a continuous
process, and therefore noun incorporation constructions are likely to be
found on a continuum between these two end points. However, we map this
continuum onto a discrete choice for annotators by taking the ability of
an incorporated noun to co-occur with an independent NP as criterial. This treatment of single words containing predicates and arguments is summarized in table 6 below.

##### Part 3-1-3-2. Valency-changing operations

Secondly, constructions used to change the valency of verbs (causatives,
applicatives, reflexives etc.) can cross-linguistically either express
the two concepts at hand in separate words (e.g. English *I **made** him
**eat***), or combine the two concepts into a single word (e.g. Sanapaná
*as-**tav-kes**-ke'* 'I made her/him eat'). In order to assess whether
one or two concepts should be identified for UMR annotation, unity under
negation is chosen as a criterion.

In English Causatives, for instance, negation can apply to the causing
event and to the caused event separately as in
<a href="#3-1-3-2 (1)">(1)</a>, indicating that the causing event and the
caused event are construed as independent predicates. Therefore, a
"cause"-event is identified in addition to the "drink"-event expressed
by the verb root.

<span id="3-1-3-2 (1)">3-1-3-2 (1)</span> 

<span id="3-1-3-2 (1a)">3-1-3-2 (1a)</span> Grandmother made the kid drink the water.
```

	:modstr FullAff)
    :actor (k2/ kid
    	:ref-number Singular)
    :undergoer (w/ water)
    :aspect Performance
    :modstr FullAff)
```

```

    :cause (m/ make
    	:actor (p/ person
	    :ARG1-of (h/ have-rel-role-92
		 :ARG3 (g/ grandmother))
	    :ref-number Singular)
    	:aspect Performance
	:modstr FullNeg)
    :actor (k2/ kid
    	:ref-number Singular)
    :undergoer (w/ water)
    :aspect Performance
    :modstr NeutAff)
```

<span id="3-1-3-2 (1c)">3-1-3-2 (1c)</span> Grandmother made the kid not drink the water.
```
(d/ drink
    :cause (m/ make
    	:actor (p/ person
	    :ARG1-of (h/ have-rel-role-92
		 :ARG3 (g/ grandmother))
	    :ref-number Singular)
    	:aspect Performance
	:modstr FullAff)
    :actor (k2/ kid
    	:ref-number Singular)
    :undergoer (w/ water)
    :aspect Performance
    :modstr FullNeg)
```

Kukama (Tupían), on the other hand, has a morphological causative, as in
<a href="#3-1-3-2 (2)">(2)</a>. The caused event and causing event cannot be
negated independently: if
<a href="#3-1-3-2 (2)">(2)</a> is negated, negation necessarily scopes over
both, indicating that this form is construed in Kukama as denoting a
single event. Therefore, only a single predicate is identified
(corresponding to the whole verb stem *kuratata* 'make drink').

<span id="3-1-3-2 (2)">3-1-3-2 (2)</span> 
```
nai		kurata-ta	churan=ui	uni-pu
grandmother	drink-CAUS	kid=PST		water-INST
'Grandmother made the kid drink the water.'
(k/ kuratata 'make drink'
    :causer (p/ person
    	:ARG1-of (h/ have-rel-role-92
		:ARG3 (n/ nai 'grandmother'))
	:ref-number Singular)
    :actor (c/ churan 'kid')
    :undergoer (u/ uni 'water')
    :aspect Performance
    :modstr FullAff)
```

This criterion will be used for all valency change concepts: if the
"lexical" concept expressed by the verb root and the valency change
concept can be negated independently, two events are identified, whereas
if they cannot be negated independently, only one event is identified
corresponding to the derived verb stem (see table 7). The semantics and valency of
such derived forms will be inferred from the participant role annotation
associated with the verb. Which valency changes lead to which argument
structures is detailed in [Part 3-2-1-2-1](#part-3-2-1-2-1-valency-alternations).

<div id="tab:valency_changes">
	
| **IF** | **THEN** |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------|
| Event and valency-changing category can be negated independently | Identify and annotate them as separate events |
| Event and valency-changing category cannot be negated independently | Identify a single event |

##### Part 3-1-3-3. TAM categories

Third, some semantic categories such as (phasal) aspect, temporal
relations, and modal relations, can be expressed cross-linguistically
either through bound morphology or through separate words (often called
"auxiliaries").

Phasal aspectual meanings such as inchoative, completive, and
continuative, firstly, are never identified as separate events, even if
they are expressed through independent words. Instead, they will simply
inform the aspect attribute label of the event they modify ([Part 3-3-1](#part-3-3-1-Aspect)). This principle is illustrated in example
<a href="#3-1-3-3 (1)">(1)</a>. In
Manipuri, the inchoative concept and the "close"-meaning form part of
the same word, while in the English translation, they are expressed as
two different words (example from Bhat 1999). Nevertheless, in both the English and the Manipuri
UMR, only one event is identified (corresponding to concept of property
predication, in this case).

<span id="3-1-3-3 (1)">3-1-3-3 (1)</span> 
```
ce	əsi	mu-re
paper	this	black-change
'This paper has become black.'
(h/ have-mod-91					(h/ have-mod-91
    :ARG1 (c/ ce 'paper')			    :ARG1 (p/ paper)
    	:mod (s/ əsi 'this')			        :mod (t/ this)
    :ARG2 (m/ mu 'black')			    :ARG2 (b/ black)
    :aspect Performance)			    :aspect Performance)
```

Similarly, modal and temporal auxiliaries will not be identified
independently as events, but will instead inform the modal and temporal
dependency annotation: in English, for example, modal auxiliaries such
as *might* and *should* in *He **might/should** go to school* are not
identified as independent events, and neither are temporal auxiliaries
such as *have* and *be* in *She **has gone/is going** to school*. How
such meanings exactly inform the temporal and modal annotation is
detailed in [Part 4-2](#part-4-2-temporal-dependency) and [Part 4-3](#part-4-3-modal-dependency).

For some semi-modal concepts, there may be language-internal semantic
evidence that they are construed as independent concepts. For instance,
in the English desiderative construction in
<a href="#3-1-3-3 (2)">(2)</a>, the desire-event can be modalized
independently of the "go"-event, indicating that desires are construed
as independent events in English. The UMR therefore has predicates for
both *want* and *go*.

<span id="3-1-3-3 (2)">3-1-3-3 (2)</span> 

<span id="3-1-3-3 (2a)">3-1-3-3 (2a)</span> She wants to go to school.
```
(w/ want-01
    :ARG0 (p/ person
    	:ref-person 3rd
	:ref-number Singular)
    :ARG1 (g/ go-01
    	:ARG1 p
        :ARG4 (s/ school)
        :aspect Performance
	:modpred w)
    :aspect State
    :modstr FullAff)
```
<span id="3-1-3-3 (2b)">3-1-3-3 (2b)</span> She may want to go to school.
```
(w/ want-01
    :ARG0 (p/ person
    	:ref-person 3rd
	:ref-number Singular)
    :ARG1 (g/ go-01
    	:ARG1 p
        :ARG4 (s/ school)
        :aspect Performance
	:modpred w)
    :aspect State
    :modstr NeutAff)
```

However, if in a language the desire-event cannot be modalized
independently from the desired event, no separate event is identified
for the desire-semantics. Instead, the desiderative is taken into
account in the modal annotation, as detailed in [Part 4-3](#part-4-3-modal-dependency). For three
other semi-modal concepts, the same guidelines as to concept-word
mismatches are used as for desideratives: this is the case for conatives
('try to'), optatives ('wish that'), and frustratives ('fail to').

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

##### Part 3-1-3-4. Associated Motion

Associated motion constructions are treated in a similar way to
semi-modals. If associated motion events can have their own argument
structure (i.e. if they can co-occur with NPs expressing start points or
end points of motion events), these motion events are identified as
separate predicates in the UMR. If they cannot take their own argument
structure, only one event is identified.

For instance, the Sanapaná associated motion construction in
<a href="#3-1-3-4 (1)">(1)</a> expresses that the sleeping-event takes place during a motion event
towards the deictic center: the suffix *-ant* essentially means that the
event expressed by the verb root happens "while coming here". As shown
in <a href="#3-1-3-4 (1)">(1)</a>, this construction can co-occur with a spatial NP. However, such a spatial NP can only express the location of the sleeping-event rather
than the goal or the start point of the motion event. It is therefore
better analyzed as a circumstantial locative belonging to the
"sleep"-event expressed by the verb root than as an argument of the
motion event. The motion event itself therefore has no independent
argument structure, and only one event is identified for UMR annotation.

<span id="3-1-3-4 (1)">3-1-3-4 (1)</span> 
```
en-na'-ten-ek-ant-a'		La	Esperanza
1PL-DSTR-sleep-TI-VNT-NOM	La	Esperanza

    :place (c/ city					    :place (c/ city
    	:name (n/ name					        :name (n/ name
            :op1 "La"						    :op1 "La"
            :op2 "Esperanza"))				    	    :op2 "Esperanza"))
    :aspect State					    :temporal (c2/ come-01
    :modstr FullAff)					        :ARG1 p
    								:ARG4 (h/ here)
                                                        	:aspect Activity
                                                        	:modstr FullAff)
                                                    	    :aspect State
                                                   	    :modstr FullAff)
```

The English "venitive" construction in the translational equivalent of
<a href="#3-1-3-4 (1)">(1)</a>, however, can co-occur with an NP which is clearly an argument of the "come"-event: one could say, for instance *We slept in La Esperanza
while coming here **from Puerto Casado***. Therefore, the motion event
and the "sleep"-event are construed in English as two independent
events, and are annotated in UMR as two separate predicates.

##### Part 3-1-3-5. Light verb constructions
A light verb construction takes the canonical form of a verb followed by an eventive noun, and the verb has little meaning while the nound 
carries most of the semantic content. An example is in <a href="#3-1-3-5 (1)">(1)</a>, where ``do'' is a light verb and most of the semantic content comes from 
``interview''. In this case the UMR concept ``interview-01'' is created based on the eventive noun, while the verb is simply dropped. Note however 
the verb may contribute to the aspectual attribute of the concept.

##### Part 3-1-3-6. Non-verbal clauses

Many types of "non-verbal clauses", such as predicate nominals and
predication of properties, possession, and location (see [Part 3-1-1-3](#part-3-1-1-3-states-and-entities) for the UMR predicates that are used to annotate these meanings), show different
mappings between concepts and words across languages. According to typological studies by Stassen (1997, 2009), Heine (1997), and Creissels (2019), there are three cross-linguistically common strategies for the expression of such meanings. English uses an
easily identifiable "verbal" predicate with argument NPs, as seen in the
English translational equivalents of the Kukama examples in
<a href="#3-1-3-6 (1)">(1)</a> and <a href="#3-1-3-6 (2)">(2)</a>. In English, these constructions do not pose
serious problems to the predicate-argument structure of UMR - one could
simply identify the "have" or "be"-verb as a predicate, and the NPs in
the clause as its arguments.

In the Kukama object predication construction in
<a href="#3-1-3-6 (1)">(1)</a>, however, the predicate does not map to
an overt word: object predication is expressed through juxtaposition of
two NPs, with the predicational meaning implicit but inherent in the
construction. In the Kukama thetic possession construction in <a href="#3-1-3-6 (2)">(2)</a>, on the other hand, the possessum
and the relation of possession are expressed together as a single word
which functions as a predicate: something that is typically thought of
as an "argument" is predicativized. In languages that use the construction type exemplified in <a href="#3-1-3-6 (2)">(2)</a>, there is only one of the participants that can act as the predicate cross-linguistically. For example, in languages that use a <a href="#3-1-3-6 (2)">(2)</a>-type strategy for object predication, it is always the object category participant and never the theme participant that morphosyntactically looks like a predicate. Both these structures pose problems
for the annotation of predicate-argument structure, since there is no
separate material that can be identified as a predicate.

We propose a set of seven abstract concept predicates each corresponding
to a discrete "non-verbal clause" function, listed in the table below. When there is no overt predicate-word, as
in <a href="#3-1-3-6 (1)">(1)</a>, we assume that annotators will be able
to recognize the type of non-verbal clause function they are dealing
with. They should use such an abstract predicate concept as predicative core of the graph, and use the appropriate numbered argument roles as specified in
the table (see also [Part 3-2-1-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-1-non-verbal-clauses) for more in-depth treatment of the argument structure annotation with these predicates).

In constructions with predicativized arguments, such as
<a href="#3-1-3-6 (2)">(2)</a>, once again annotators are expected to recognize the type of non-verbal clause function at hand and select the appropriate predicate. An argument concept will be identified and linked to the predicativized participant word in the sentence - the possessum *ɨara-yara* in the case of <a href="#3-1-3-6 (2)">(2)</a>. As can be seen in the example UMRs
above, the resulting graphs have similar structures regardless of
whether a language uses an overt-predicate strategy, a zero-predicate
(juxtaposition) strategy, or a predicativized argument strategy for such
"non-verbal clause" meanings.

In languages with simpler morphology, the opposite situation, *multi-word concepts* may arise. Multi-word concepts can simply be handled by
concatenating the lemmatized words, as in <a href="#3-1-3-7 (1)">(1)</a>. In <a href="#3-1-3-7 (1a)">(1a)</a>, *take-out-11* is a multi-word concept, meaning a UMR concept that maps to multiple words. In this case, the multi-word concept also has more than one sense, as indicated by the sense number *11*.


<span id="3-1-3-7 (1)">3-1-3-7 (1)</span>

<span id="3-1-3-7 (1a)">3-1-3-7 (1a)</span> So I normally steep it in hot water , then take it out and stir - fry it.
```
(c/ cause-01
      :ARG1 (a/ and
            :op1 (s/ steep-01
                  :ARG0 (p/ person

                  :ARG1 (t/ thing

                  :ARG2 (w/ water
                        :ARG1-of (h/ hot-05))

            :op2 (a2/ and
                  :op1 (t2/ take-out-11

                  :op2 (s2/ stir-01

                  :op3 (f/ fry-01

			:modstr FullAff)
                  :temporal (t3/ then)))
      :ARG1-of (n/ normal-02))
```

Multi-word concepts are not limited phrasal verbs like ``take out''. They also include idiomatic expressions like ``jump on the bandwagon'', as in 
<a href="#3-1-3-7 (1b)">(1b)</a>:

<span id="3-1-3-7 (1b)">3-1-3-7 (1b)</span>  Pretty soon the far left loons will jump on his wagon.
```
(j / jump-on-bandwagon-09
      :aspect Performance
      :ARG0 (l / loon
            :ARG1-of (l2 / left-19
                  :degree (f / far)))
      :ARG1 (p / person
               :ref-person 3rd
	       :ref-number Singular)
      :time (s / soon
            :mod (p / pretty)))
```
Note that these muli-word concepts are predicates and have their own arguments. Other multi-word concepts are not predicates and are simply concatenation of 
single words, as in <a href="#3-1-3-7 (1c)">(1c)</a>, where the multi-word concept is *as-well*, which maps to two words.

<span id="3-1-3-7 (1c)">3-1-3-7 (1c)</span> The moral aspects of the movement intrigued him as well
```
(i/ intrigue-01
      :ARG0 (a/ aspect
            :ARG1-of (m/ moral-02)
            :poss (m2/ movement-07)
	    :ref-number Plural)
      :ARG1 (p/ person
            :ref-person 3rd
	    :ref-number Singular)
      :mod (a2/ as-well)
      :aspect State
      :modstr FullAff)
```


In languages like Chinese where there are no natural word boundaries in written text, sentences will have to go through a word segmentation process to facilitate the mapping of words into UMR concepts. Consecutive sequences of Chinese characters that form a single concept will always be segmented into a single word. This is the case for idioms such as 缘木求鱼, 刻舟求剑, which are segmented into single words, and  are mapped to single concepts in UMR annotation.  However, multi-word concepts are still relevant if the sequence of words that form a single concept are discontinuous, as 帮-忙-01 in <a href="#3-1-3-6 (2a)">(2a)</a>:

<span id="3-1-3-7 (2a)">3-1-3-7 (2a)</span> 这 办法 帮 不 了 我 多 大 忙 ， 点灯人 说 。
```
(x0 / 说-01
      :arg0  (x11 / 人
            :arg0-of  (x12 / 点-01
                  :arg1  (x13 / 灯)))
      :arg1  (x14 / 帮-忙-01
            :degree  (x20 / 大-01
                         :polarity  (x15 / -))
            :arg0  (x16 / 办法
                  :mod  (x17 / 这))
            :arg1  x11)
      :aspect Performance
      :modstr FullAff)
```

Multi-word concepts are also relevant for idiomatic expressions that are segmented into multiple words but mapped single concepts.

<span id="3-1-3-7 (2b)">3-1-3-7 (2b)</span> 我 把 锤子 、 螺钉 、 饥渴 、 死亡 ， 全都 抛在 脑 后 。
```
(x0 / 抛在脑后-01
      :arg0  (x2 / individual-person
                 :ref-person 1st
		 :ref-number Singular)
      :arg1  (x3 / and
            :op1  (x4 / 锤子)
            :op2  (x5 / 螺钉)
            :op3  (x6 / 饥渴)
            :op4  (x7 / 死亡))
      :manner  (x11 / 全-01)
      :manner  (x12 / 都)
      :aspect Performance)
```

##### Part 3-1-3-8. Miscellaneous constructions
Other than multi-word concepts, languages often have regular or irregular constructions that involve mapping multipe words to single concepts. We adopt the general approach of AMR, which is to propose a set of abstract predicates each of which has their semantic roles to annotate such constructions. <a href="#3-1-3-8 (1)">(1)</a> is such an example, where the abstract concept ``correlate-91'' is proposed to annotate the ``the X-er, the Y-er`` construction. 
<!--which concepts are languages-specific, and which are uniform? -->


<span id="3-1-3-8 (1)">3-1-3-8 (1)</span> The more I read your stuff, the more I am convinced that you have a black heart.

```

       :aspect Habitual
       :ARG1 (m / more
                  :frequency-of (r / read-01
                        :ARG0 (p / person
			         :ref-person  1st
				 :ref-number Singular)
                        :ARG1 (s2 / stuff
                              :poss (p2 / person
			                :ref-person 2nd
					:ref-number Singular))))
        :ARG2 (m2 / more
                  :ARG3-of (h3 / have-degree-91
                        :ARG1 0
                        :ARG2 (c / convince-01
                              :ARG1 p
                              :ARG2 (h / have-03
                                    :ARG0 p2
                                    :ARG1 (h2 / heart
                                          :ARG1-of (b / black-06)))))))
```

#### Part 3-1-4. Word senses
 
 UMR allows concepts to be word senses. In order to annotate word senses, it is necessary to first have a sense inventory for all words that need to be sense-disambiguated. For languages that do not have a sense inventory, concepts can simply be represented by lemmas. For predicate concepts which the annotator wants to flag for later inclusion in a lexicon, the suffix -00 can be added to such lemmas. It is also possible that a language only has a sense inventory for a subset of the words. This is the case with English <a href="#3-1-4 (1)">(1)</a> and Chinese <a href="#3-1-4 (2)">(2)</a>, where word senses are defined for predicates together with their arguments in *frame files*.

<span id="3-1-4 (1)">3-1-4 (1)</span> The school has approximately 570 pupils.
``` 
(h/ have-91

 #### Part 3-1-5. Scope for Quantification and negation

To facilitate the translation of UMR into first-order expressions to support logical inference,
we add a **scope** concept to represent the relative order of the predicate, quantified concept and negated concept.
In most cases, the order of these elements are interpreted in textual order, and do not need an over scope annotation.
The scope annotation is only needed when these elements are interpreted "out-of-order", as in <a href="#3-1-5 (1)">(1)</a>.

<span id="3-1-5 (1)">3-1-5 (1)</span>
```
Someone didn't answer all the questions
(a/ answer-01
   :ARG0 (p/ person)
   :ARG1 (q/ question
              :quant A
              :polarity -)
   :Pred-of (s/ scope
                :ARG0 p
                :ARG1 q))
```

Related to scope is the issue of distributive vs. collective interpretations of events. Ambiguities in this realm may arise in a great number of different contexts. They may be triggered by, amongst others, explicit quantifiers or numerals, or events with plural arguments. For example, in <a href="#3-1-5 (2)">(2)</a> below, is there a single woman which every man loves, or does every man love a different woman? The latter interpretation is distributive, the former is usually interpreted as collective.

<span id="3-1-5 (2)">3-1-5 (2)</span>

<span id="3-1-5 (2a)">3-1-5 (2a)</span> Each man loves a woman.

However, many cases that are technically ambiguous nevertheless have a strong default reading stemming from the lexical semantics of the predicate and its arguments. For example, in <a href="#3-1-5 (3a)">(3a)</a>, there is a strong default interpretation that every single student ran 5 kilometers rather than that they ran a total of 5 kilometers between them - _run_ is typically an individual activity, so its lexical semantics trigger a default distributive reading. However, in <a href="#3-1-5 (3b)">(3b)</a>, the equally strong default interpretation is that the students carried a single piano together and there was only a single carrying-event - our world knowledge specifies that things as heavy as a piano must typically be carried by multiple people, so the lexical semantics of the predicate-argument combination here trigger a default collective reading. In yet another set of cases, our "default" feeling is that it does not really matter in what configurations the participants participate in the denoted events. In <a href="#3-1-5 (3c)">(3c)</a>, all that typically matters is that 6 states were hit by at least one hurricane each, and that there was a total of 10 hurricanes. We can't really know how many hurricanes hit each state, and we don't really care - all we know is that 6 states and 10 hurricanes were involved. This kind of default interpretation is called a summation reading.
					
<span id="3-1-5 (3)">3-1-5 (3)</span>

<span id="3-1-5 (3a)">3-1-5 (3a)</span> The linguistics students ran 5 kilometers to raise money for charity.

<span id="3-1-5 (3b)">3-1-5 (3b)</span> The linguistics students carried a piano into the theater.

<span id="3-1-5 (3c)">3-1-5 (3c)</span> Ten hurricanes hit six states over the weekend.

Scope will not be annotated for summation readings (as we cannot reliably know it from the text alone), nor is it annotated where a distributive or collective reading can be predictably derived from the lexical semantics. In other words, whenever _run_ is interpreted distributively or _carry a piano_ is interpreted collectively, no scope annotation is needed. The scope annotation only comes into play when some overt linguistic element forces an interpretation that diverges from the lexical default. For example, in <a href="#3-1-5 (4a)">(4a)</a>, _together_ forces a collective interpretation of _run_, in <a href="#3-1-5 (4b)">(4b)</a>, _each_ forces a distributive interpretation of _carry a piano_, and in <a href="#3-1-5 (4c)">(4c)</a>, _each_ similarly forces a distributive interpretation of _hit_. In all these cases, a (s/ scope) predicate would appear to clarify the non-canonical scopal relations.

<span id="3-1-5 (4)">3-1-5 (4)</span>

<span id="3-1-5 (4a)">3-1-5 (4a)</span> The linguistics students together ran 200 kilometers to raise money for charity.

<span id="3-1-5 (4b)">3-1-5 (4b)</span> The bodybuilders each carried a piano into the theater.

<span id="3-1-5 (4c)">3-1-5 (4c)</span> Ten hurricanes each hit six states over the weekend.

#### Part 3-1-6. Discourse-relations

When multiple events are expressed in a complex sentence, a variety of semantic relations can hold between them. UMR provides annotators with a lattice of category values to annotate such discourse-level event-event relations. This lattice is based partly on existing typological research (Malchukov 2004; Thompson & Longacre 1985), and partly on patterns of expression through adverbial subordination or coordination in English. This lattice covers event-event relations that are typically overtly and obligatorily expressed in languages through either (coordinating or subordinating) conjunctions or dedicated (“deranked”) verb forms. In other words, it does not cover relations typically expressed through optional “discourse adverbs”.

![Discourse Lattice_2022](https://github.com/umr4nlp/umr-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines_figures/Discourse%20Lattice_May2022.png)

Annotators may choose annotation values from more fine-grained levels of the lattice when they are confident in doing so, or from more course-grained levels when they are in doubt. Generally, (adverbial) subordination constructions express overtly more fine-grained values. Many of these are already treated in other parts of UMR (particularly through participant roles), in which case cross-references will lead annotators to the relevant sections of this document. Coordination constructions tend to be more polysemous – they subsume various more fine-grained values and may be ambiguous between them, and they might therefore require the use of higher-level categories. This description already hints at the observation that many of the event-event relations on this lattice can be expressed through either coordination or subordination. We follow Talmy (1978), Reinhart (1984), and Wierzbicka (1980) in taking this difference not to be a semantic one, but rather an information-structural one between a “complex figure” construal (both events are equally “prominent”) and a “figure-ground” construal (one event is “foregrounded” and another is “backgrounded”). We therefore do not require annotators to annotate the same meaning differently when expressed through coordination as opposed to subordination (although, as mentioned before, subordination constructions may allow for the identification of more fine-grained meanings). In the examples below, both options are illustrated wherever possible.

Each discourse relation on the lattice is defined below, based on Croft (2022, ch. 15, ch. 17).

```Disjunctive```: Construes two (or more) events as being alternatives of each other in some way. Roughly corresponds to the range of meanings expressed by English _(either) or_. UMR expresses this meaning through an abstract concept ```or``` which takes numbered ```:opX``` arguments for the construed alternatives as in <a href="#3-1-6 (1)">(1)</a>.

<span id="3-1-6 (1)">3-1-6 (1)</span>
```
I will go for a walk or play some soccer.
(o/ or
   :op1 (w/ walk-01
   	:ARG0 (p/ person
		:ref-person 1st
		:ref-number Singular)
	:aspect Process
	:modstr FullAff)
   :op2 (p2/ play-01
   	:ARG0 p
	:ARG1 (s/ soccer)
	:aspect Process
	:modstr FullAff))
```

There are two more fine-grained subtypes of disjunctive relations:

```Inclusive Disjunctive```: also known as “non-exhaustive disjunction”. Indicates that either any of the construed alternatives can be “chosen” individually, or any combination of the construed alternatives. This is illustrated in <a href="#3-1-6 (2a)">(2a)</a> from Hua (Haiman 1978:7-8). Here, _-ve_ indicates that bashing pandanus, husking and eating corn, and planting bananas are not mutually exclusive alternatives. Performing any or all of these actions equally violates a sexual taboo. UMR uses an abstract concept ```inclusive-disj``` to annotate this meaning, with numbered ```:opX``` roles for the construed alternatives.

```Exclusive Disjunctive```: also known as “exhaustive disjunction”. Indicates that the construed alternatives are presented as mutually exclusive options. This is illustrated in <a href="#3-1-6 (2b)">(2b)</a> from Hua (Haiman 1980:271). Here, _ito_ indicates that his being here and his not being here are mutually exclusive alternatives. UMR uses an abstract concept ```exclusive-disj``` to annotate this meaning, with numbered ```:opX``` roles for the construed alternatives.

```

The exclusive disjunction relation has one further, more specific subtype:

```Apprehensive```: expresses that two events are mutually exclusive alternatives, but more specifically, that one event is carried out with the intention of preventing the other event from happening. It is in a way a negated counterpart of the `purpose` relation discussed below. In <a href="#3-1-6 (3)">(3)</a>, the implication is that if the addressee of the imperative grabs a stick, they will not be attacked - the grab-event and the attack-event are mutually exclusive alternatives. As illustrated in <a href="#3-1-6 (3)">(3)</a>, English has a dedicated subordinator to express apprehensive relations, but may also draw on its polysemous disjunctive coordinator, which has apprehensive as one of its functions. In the latter case, annotators may either use the higher-level category (the ```or``` abstract concept) in the lattice, or if they are confident, the lower-level category (using the ```:apprehensive``` relation. The same holds for many of the other fine-grained meanings discussed below - illustrative annotations will not be provided for all of them.

```

```Additive```: expresses the addition of one “figure” (foregrounded participant or event) to another one in order to form a complex figure. This is represented in UMR through an ```additive``` abstract concept with numbered ```:opX``` roles. The additive function has a number of more fine-grained subfunctions:

```Simultaneous```: expresses full or partial temporal overlap of the events that together form a complex figure. This is illustrated in <a href="#3-1-6 (4a)">(4a)</a> - the reading-event and the listening-event take place, at least in part, at the same time. This function is annotated at the sentence level using the ```:temporal``` participant role relation (see [Part 3-2-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-stage-0)), and at the document level through the :overlap temporal relation (see [Part 4-2-2](#part-4-2-2-temporal-relations)).

```(pure) Addition```: expresses no temporal specification of the sequencing of events, but rather that the two events that form a complex figure cannot occur separately from each other in the context of the utterance. In <a href="#3-1-6 (4b)">(4b)</a>, having either your hand stamped or showing your ticket stub alone is not sufficient to get into the concert - both are necessary. UMR uses a ```:pure-addition``` relation to connect two events semantically related in this way.

```Substitution```: expresses that one of the events that together form a complex figure is offered as an “alternative” or “replacement” for the other – this is typically expressed through the negation of one of the two coordinands, as in <a href="#3-1-6 (4c)">(4c)</a>. The acceptability of both _and_ and _but_ here illustrates that the substitutive function is intermediate between the conjunctive and adversative higher-level categories (see below). Substitutive meanings are annotated with the ```:substitute``` relation, which takes the event being replaced as its child and the replacement event as its parent. The rejected alternative is annotated as `:ARG2`, while the replacement is annotated as `:ARG1`.

```Consecutive```: expresses two or more events as a complex figure, with additional information on their temporal and/or logical sequencing. Just like the ```additive``` meaning, this is represented in UMR through a ```consecutive``` abstract concept with numbered ```:opX``` relations. The temporal relations holding between the events can then be further specified in the document-level temporal annotation. More fine-grained sub-functions of the consecutive function are the following:

```Purpose```: expresses the intention on the part of the agent of one event towards bringing about another event, as in <a href="#3-1-6 (5a)">(5a)</a>. This relation is annotated using the `:purpose` participant role relation (see [Part 3-2-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-stage-0)).

```Means```: expresses a relation where one event accompanies another and characterizes more specifically what happened (or didn't happen) in another event, as in <a href="#3-1-6 (5b)">(5b)</a>. This relation has also been called “positive circumstantial”. This relation is annotated using the `:manner` participant role relation (see [Part 3-2-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-stage-0)).

```Causal```: expresses a relation between a causing event and a resulting event, where the former explicitly brings about the latter, as in <a href="#3-1-6 (5c)">(5c)</a>. This relation is annotated using the `cause-01` predicate or the `:cause` participant role relation (see [Part 3-2-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-stage-0)).

```Conditional```: expresses a relation where one event is contingent upon the occurrence of another event, as in <a href="#3-1-6 (5d)">(5d)</a>. This relation is annotated using the `have-condition-91` predicate or the `:condition` participant role relation (see [Part 3-2-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-stage-0), [Part 4-3-1-5](#part-4-3-1-5-condition-relation)).

```Anterior```: expresses that one event takes place before another. This can either be expressed through an adverbial construction with the earlier event in the main clause and the later event in a subordinate clause, or through iconicity of tense in coordinated clauses with the earlier event in the sequentially prior clause, all exemplified in <a href="#3-1-6 (5e)">(5e)</a>. This relation is annotated at the sentence level, using the `:temporal` participant role relation (see [Part 3-2-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-stage-0)), and at the document level (see [Part 4-2-2](#part-4-2-2-temporal-relations)).

```Posterior```: expresses that one event takes place following another. This can either be expressed through an adverbial construction with the later event in the main clause and the earlier event in a subordinate clause, or through iconicity of tense in coordinated clauses with the later event in the sequentially later clause, all exemplified in <a href="#3-1-6 (5f)">(5f)</a>. This relation is annotated at the sentence level, using the `:temporal` participant role relation (see [Part 3-2-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-stage-0)), and at the document level (see [Part 4-2-2](#part-4-2-2-temporal-relations)).

Together, the additive and consecutive functions and all their subfunctions can be subsumed under the higher-level, more coarse-grained conjunctive function, marked in UMR with the ```and``` abstract concept and numbered ```:opX``` roles. That these functions are all semantically related and that their conjoining under the higher-level function is appropriate is illustrated by _and_ being the English coordinator used to express all these functions when a complex-figure construal is chosen.

```(pure) Contrast```: expresses a relation of contrast in some way between events, without an element of unexpectedness. In <a href="#3-1-6 (6a)">(6a)</a>, properties attributed to Peter are contrasted with properties attributed to Vanja. Unlike with the “unexpected co-occurrence” relation below, there is no expectation that whenever two people are discussed and one of them is diligent, the other must be lazy. This meaning is annotated using the ```contrast-91``` abstract predicate and its numbered argument roles.

```Unexpected co-occurrence```: expresses a relation of juxtaposition between two events where the second event is unexpected in case the first occurs. For example, in <a href="#3-1-6 (6b)">(6b)</a> from Russian (Malchukov 2004:180), it is unexpected that Vanja went to school given that she had a cold - the sentence implies, in other words, that people who have a cold usually do not go to school. UMR uses a ```unexpected-co-occurrence-91``` abstract concept with ```:ARG1``` and ```:ARG2``` roles to represent this meaning.

```

There are three subtypes of unexpected co-occurrence relations that confident annotators, or annotators for languages which have overt grammatical mechanisms of disambiguating them, may distinguish:

```Negative circumstantial```: expresses that the lack of occurrence of one event is a specific characterization of the other event, in the same way that the `means` relation discussed above expresses that the occurrence of one event is a specific characterization of another event. This meaning is classified as a subtype of “unexpected cooccurrence” because typically, the “more specific”, “characterizing” event that did not happen is only expressed overtly if the general expectation is that it _would_ happen. Compare the difference in naturalness between <a href="#3-1-6 (7a)">(7a)</a> and <a href="#3-1-6 (7b)">(7b)</a>: the former sounds natural because we assume that, when carrying a bowl of punch, spills are a fairly common occurrence. The latter is not ungrammatical, but it implies that Sarah usually does a somersault whenever she carries bowls of punch. This relation is annotated using the `:manner` participant role relation (see [Part 3-2-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-stage-0)), and a negative polarity attribute (see [Part 3-3-3](#part-3-3-3-polarity)).

```Concessive```: expresses a relation between two events towards which the speaker has a positive epistemic stance (i.e. the speaker believes they both occurred/will occur), but specifies that this co-occurrence is unexpected. Concessives have also been treated as negative causal relations (Comrie 1986). For instance, in <a href="#3-1-6 (7c)">(7c)</a>, the speaker asserts that both the state of being broke and the guitar-buying event occurred in the real world. The concessive _even though_ specifies that typically being broke causes one to not buy new guitars. This relation is annotated using the ```have-concession-91``` predicate or the shortcut ```:concession``` relation (see [Part 3-2-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-stage-0), [Part 4-3](#part-4-3-modal-dependency)).

```Concessive conditional```: expresses that the state of affairs described in the apodosis will be true under the entire range of conditions described in the protasis. Concessive conditionals are different from regular conditionals in that they imply an expectation that the event expressed in the protasis may not lead to the event expressed in the apodosis happening. For instance, in <a href="#3-1-6 (7d)">(7d)</a>, there is an expectation that a mere five minutes of tardiness is not likely to cause one to be fired, and the concessive conditional contradicts this expectation: in the entire range of possible tardiness events, the event in the apodosis (being fired) will take place. This relation is annotated using the ```concessive-condition``` relation.

```

Lastly, the “(pure) contrast” meaning has a more fine-grained “subtraction” value, where one event is
additionally characterized by the absence of a second event that is normally a part of
the first event (Croft, to appear). UMR handles this meaning through a ```:subtraction``` relation that takes the absent second event as its child (see <a href="#3-1-6 (8)">(8)</a>.

<span id="3-1-6 (8)">3-1-6 (8)</span>

			:op2 "Exotic"))
	:Aspect State
	:MODSTR FullNeg)
```

Some languages co-express the “(pure) contrast” and the “unexpected co-occurrence” meanings, using the same form to express both. These two meanings are therefore subsumed under the `adversative` category on the lattice, annotated in UMR using the ```but-91``` abstract concept and ```:ARG1``` and ```:ARG2``` argument roles. However, both the “(pure) contrast” and the “unexpected co-occurrence meaning” may also be co-expressed with conjunctive meanings. Therefore, these categories combine into a number of higher-level, more coarse-grained categories on the UMR lattice above:

```And + unexpected```: abstract concept that may be used if a language does not formally distinguish conjuctive relations from unexpected co-occurrence relations. The language may still have a distinct form to express pure contrast. This abstract concept takes numbered ```:opX``` roles.

```And + contrast```: abstract concept that may be used if a language does not formally distinguish conjunctive relations from pure contrast relations. The language may still have a distinct form for expressing unexpected cooccurrence. This abstract concept takes numbered ```:opX``` roles.

```And + but```: abstract concept that may be used if a language does not formally distinguish between conjunctive relations and adversative relations at all. This abstract concept takes numbered ```:opX``` roles.

### Part 3-2. UMR relations 

   #### Part 3-2-1. Participant roles 
   
Every entity and event identified as a participant is related to an
event (the event that it is dependent on) and annotated with a
participant role label. The participant role annotation is organized as a road map with different stages. The factor which
determines where a language begins on the road map is whether there is
an existing PropBank-style lexicon (frame files) for the language which defines predicate-specific roles. An English PropBank
frame file is shown in <a href="#3-2-1 (1)">(1)</a>.

<span id="3-2-1 (1)">3-2-1 (1)</span>
```
Predicate: give.01  
	Roles:    
	Arg0: giver   
	Arg1: thing given    
	Arg2: entity given to    
```
Following AMR, UMR uses PropBank frame files to annotate lexicalized
participant roles. But, this only works for languages which have
PropBank-style frame files. This is considered the ‘Stage 1’ participant
role annotation (see [Part 3-2-1-2](#part-3-2-1-2-stage-1)). The 'Stage 0' annotation involves
using a set of general participant roles, while building a lexicon of
PropBank-style frame files in order to move towards Stage 1 annotation.

Some types of valency alternations (or, argument structure alternations)
are indicated in the participant role annotation; other types of
alternations are not annotated in UMR. Not all valency alternations have
the same relationship between the basic construction and the non-basic
construction. Givón (1994) distinguishes semantic and pragmatic valency
alternations. In semantic alternations, the basic and non-basic
constructions differ in terms of the semantic content that they express,
i.e., they don’t refer to the same “real-world” event. Reciprocals are
an example of a semantic alternation, seen below in
<a href="#3-2-1 (2)">(2)</a> from Torau (Parkinson 2018:53).

<span id="3-2-1 (2)">3-2-1 (2)</span>

<span id="3-2-1 (2a)">3-2-1 (2a)</span>
```
ta-di=lo	daki-a		tioni	arimi 		ta 	besu

```

<span id="3-2-1 (2b)">3-2-1 (2b)</span>
```
ta-di=lama 	ari 	da-daki 	uua=i
PFV-3PL.S-TAM	REC	RDP-find	in.that.direction=LOC
‘They had found each other.’
```

The event described in <a href="#3-2-1 (2a)">(2a)</a> is different than the
event described in <a href="#3-2-1 (2b)">(2b)</a> - in the former, the finder and findee are different, while in the latter they are the same. This is in contrast to
valency alternations which reflect a pragmatic difference between the
basic and non-basic construction. With pragmatic alternations, both
constructions refer to the same “real-world” event, but they package
that information differently, often in terms of the topicality (or,
discourse salience) of participants. Passive constructions are an
example of a pragmatic valency alternation, as seen in
<a href="#3-2-1 (3)">(3)</a> from Balinese (Shibatani and Artawa 2013).

<span id="3-2-1 (3)">3-2-1 (3)</span>

<span id="3-2-1 (3a)">3-2-1 (3a)</span>
```
anak=e 		muani	cenik	ento 	ngajeng buah=e 		ento

‘The boy ate the fruit.’
```
<span id="3-2-1 (3b)">3-2-1 (3b)</span>
```
buah=e 		ento 	ajeng=a 	teken 	anak=e 		muani 	cenik	ento
fruit=DEF	that	eat=PASS	by	person=DEF	male	small	that
‘The fruit was eaten by the boy.’
```
Here, <a href="#3-2-1 (3a)">(3a)</a> and <a href="#3-2-1 (3b)">(3b)</a> could
refer to the same event, with the main difference being the saliency or
topicality of *anak=e muani cenik* ‘the boy’.

Broadly, UMR indicates semantic valency alternations with the
participant role annotation, while pragmatic alternations are not
reflected in the UMR. This means that the participant role annotations
for <a href="#3-2-1 (2a)">(2a)</a> and <a href="#3-2-1 (2b)">(2b)</a> would be
different, where as the participant role annotation for
<a href="#3-2-1 (3a)">(3a)</a> and <a href="#3-2-1 (3b)">(3b)</a> would be the
same. The annotations for valency alternations also depend on the stage
of the road map, which will be detailed in [Part 3-2-1-1-2](#part-3-2-1-1-2-valency-alternations) and [Part 3-2-1-2-1](#part-3-2-1-2-1-valency-alternations).

##### Part 3-2-1-1. Stage 0

At Stage 0, a set of general (i.e., non-lexicalized) semantic roles are
used. These certainly will not map exactly to the grammatical marking of
argument phrases in any language, but this set of roles was selected
based on cross-linguistic patterns of argument marking. The set of
participant role labels, a brief description for each label, and
examples are shown below in Table 9.

Table 9: UMR non-lexicalized roles
</div>

These general semantic roles can be categorized based on the types of events with which they occur, shown in Table 10. Participant roles that characterize the central participant(s) in an event only occur with a specific semantic class of event. For example, ```:experiencer``` and ```:stimulus``` participants only occur with experiential events. The other general participant roles that characterize central event participants are shown in the middle column below along with their associated semantic event class. Other general participant roles (shown in the first and third columns below) occur with a wide variety of semantic event classes. Those in the first column characterize causes external to the central event. Those in the third column label various roles that characterize the external circumstances of the event. Note that UMR uses ```:temporal``` to annotate temporal circumstantials of events, while ```:time``` is only used as a daughter of date-entity concepts to annotate hours and minutes on the clock.

For the roles that characterize the central participant(s) in the event,
the best way to decide which participant role label a given participant
should receive is to consider the semantic class of the event as specified in the middle column of table 10. The
```:undergoer``` role only occurs with
change-of-state events, construed broadly to include creation and
contact events as well. The ```:undergoer```
role is used for the entity that undergoes the change-of-state, is the
endpoint of force in a contact event, or is created in a creation event,
as seen in <a href="#3-2-1-1 (1)">(1)</a>. The ```:material```
role only occurs with creation events, as in
<a href="#3-2-1-1 (1c)">(1c)</a>), and is used for the raw materials
that are transformed into the created object.

The `:experiencer` and
`:stimulus` roles always occur with
experiential events, as seen in <a href="#3-2-1-1 (4)">(4)</a>. The
`:experiencer` role is used for the
mental-level entity which attends to, reacts to, or passively
experiences the `:stimulus` role.

The `:start, :goal`, and
`:source` roles only occur with motion
events; `:place` has two different uses, one
with Motion/Location events and one with other event classes.
`:start`,
`:goal`, and
`:place` are used for locations –
`:start` is the location from which motion
originates, as in <a href="#3-2-1-1 (5a)">(5a)</a>,
`:goal` is the location in which motion
ends, as in <a href="#3-2-1-1 (5b)">(5b)</a> and <a href="#3-2-1-1 (5c)">(5c)</a>,
and `:place` is used for static locations,
as in <a href="#3-2-1-1 (5d)">(5d)</a>. The
`:source` role is in the removal subclass of
motion events; it is used for the entity from which the
`:theme` is removed, as in
<a href="#3-2-1-1 (5e)">(5e)</a>. With motion events, the
`:theme` role is used for the entity that
moves (unless the motion is volitional), as in
<a href="#3-2-1-1 (5a)">(5a)</a>.

The `:recipient` role only occurs with
transfer events, or metaphorical transfer events like communication.
With these events, the initiator of the transfer is an
`:actor`, the entity that is transferred is
the `:theme` and the entity that the
`:theme` is transferred to is labelled as
the `:recipient`. For transfer of possession
events that express the original possessor of the
`:theme`, the original possessor is
annotated as `:affectee`, as in
<a href="#3-2-1-1 (6d)">(6d)</a>.

The other participant roles can occur pretty much freely with any semantic class of event. The external cause roles are used to annotate entities that bring about the central event. The
`:actor` role is used for “active”
single-participant events, in which the single participant acts
volitionally to bring about the event, as in
<a href="#3-2-1-1 (7a)">(7a)</a>. This contrasts with “inactive”
single-participant events, in which the single participant undergoes a
change outside of its control, as in <a href="#3-2-1-1 (1a)">(1a)</a>
above. See Appendix [8](#ap:verbspr) for examples of single-participant
verbs and their participant role annotation. The
`:actor` role is also used for animate
entities that initiate an action, as in <a href="#3-2-1-1 (1b)">(1b)</a>
above.

The `:companion` role is used for the entity
that helps the `:actor` bring about the
action, as in <a href="#3-2-1-1 (7b)">(7b)</a>. Note that this role is only annotated when the `:companion`
participant is expressed separately from the
`:actor`. Plural participants and conjoined
participants, as in <a href="#3-2-1-1 (7c)">(7c)</a> and
<a href="#3-2-1-1 (7d)">(7d)</a>, are annotated with a single
`:actor` role. In some languages, a marker
may be ambiguous between a comitative marker and a conjunction. When the two participants are expressed separately in the clause, they should be treated as separate participants, annotated with `:actor` and `:companion`. When they are expressed
together, they are treated as a single
`:actor` participant.

The `:instrument` role is used for an entity
that is manipulated by one of the other external cause roles, often an `:actor`, in order to initiate the action.
The entity which manipulates the
`:instrument` may or may not be present in
the clause; see <a href="#3-2-1-1 (7e)">(7e)</a> and
<a href="#3-2-1-1 (7f)">(7f)</a>.

The `:force` role is used for inanimate physical
entities which initiate an action, or cause another entity to undergo a
change, as in <a href="#3-2-1-1 (7g)">(7g)</a>. Finally, the
`:causer` role is used for the external
initiator in some causative constructions, see [4.1.2](#pr0:alts).

See Table 9 above for examples of the circumstantial
roles. In addition, there is an `:other-role`
placeholder role that can be used when annotators are unsure of which participant role annotation is accurate for a particular participant. Also see Appendix [8](#ap:verbspr) for a list of verbs and how their microroles are annotated.

At Stage 0, participant roles that aren’t explicitly expressed in the clause do not have to be annotated, even if they are implied by the context. If the annotator is certain about them, however, they can be annotated. For example, in <a href="#3-2-1-1 (8)">(8)</a>, the
`:goal` is left implicit on the left-hand side but annotated on the right-hand side; at Stage 0, this
role may be left out of the annotation.

###### Part 3-2-1-1-1. Non-verbal clauses

There is a small set of predicates that use lexicalized roles at all stages of the road map; therefore, frame files for these predicates are created at Stage 0 annotation. These are the non-verbal clause predicates presented above in Table 8, repeated below (see also [Part 3-1-1-3](#part-3-1-1-3-states-and-entities) and [Part 3-1-3-6](#Part-3-1-3-6-Non-verbal-clauses)). Each non-verbal clause predicate has a set of numbered argument roles which map to the semantic roles as shown in Table 8.

The argument that can be predicativized in languages using the predicativized-argument strategy is always
the argument role with the highest number. The examples in <a href="#3-2-1-1-1 (1)">(1)</a> show how
non-verbal clauses are annotated with participant roles. Note that these
annotations will be the same at every stage of the road map.

###### Part 3-2-1-1-2. Valency alternations
 
Information-packaging alternations, such as passives, antipassives, or valency-rearranging applicatives, are not reflected in the annotation. That is, participants are annotated in the same way as in the basic construction in the language. If a participant is omitted, for example the agent in a passive construction as in <a href="#3-2-1-1-2 (1)">(1)</a> from Berber (Guerssel 1986:52), then it doesn't need to be annotated at Stage 0. This means that agentless passives and anticausatives may have the same participant role annotation at Stage 0. Annotators may choose to annotate omitted participants that are semantically present at Stage 0.

Certain types of semantic valency alternations are reflected in the participant role annotation. At Stage 0, these alternations influence the choice of general participant role labels. 

**Causatives.** There are a few different types of causatives that
require different annotation solutions. For most causatives of
transitives, the causer is annotated as
`:causer`, the causee as
`:actor`, and the rest of the participants
receive the same annotation labels that they would in a a non-causative
construction. In <a href="#3-2-1-1-2 (2)">(2)</a> from Kukama, *nai*
‘grandmother’ is annotated as `:causer`,
the causee *churan* ‘kid’ is annotated as
`:actor`, and *uni* ‘water’ as `:undergoer`.

<span id="3-2-1-1-2 (2)">3-2-1-1-2 (2)</span>
```

    :aspect Performance
    :modstr FullAff)

There are certain causatives of transitives which do not use the `:causer` role. These are constructions which express transfer events, including mental/cognitive transfer. Some
languages express these types of events with monomorphemic verbs, like English, but other languages use causatives of transitive verbs.
Languages may differ in terms of which types of causative constructions are construed as transfer; in order to annotate the same semantic events in the same way across languages, the `:actor, :theme, :recipient` roles are used for transfer of possession (giving), sending, and mental transfer, which includes showing and communication. Bezhta in <a href="#3-2-1-1-2 (3b)">(3b)</a> (Comrie, Khalilov, Khalilova 2015:560) uses the causative of *b-egā-yo* ‘see’ as equivalent to English *show*.

For causatives of ditransitives, the causer receives the
`:causer` role, the causee the `:actor` role, and the other participants receive the same annotation as in a non-causative construction. This can be seen in <a href="#3-2-1-1-2 (4)">(4)</a> from Shipibo-Konibo
(Valenzuela 2003:612). If ‘the man’ was expressed in the clause, that participant would be annotated as `:recipient`.

There are two types of causatives of intransitives, based on the two types of intransitives. For intransitives whose single participant corresponds to an `:undergoer` role, such as
change-of-state verbs in many languages, the causer is annotated as `:actor` and the single participant retains
its `:undergoer` label. This can be seen in
<a href="#3-2-1-1-2 (5)">(5)</a> from Falam Chin (King 2011:195) below.

Regardless of whether the causative or anticausative verb is derived (or if neither is derived), the anticausative/intransitive meaning is annotated with a single `:undergoer` participant and the causative/transitive meaning is annotated with an
`:actor` and an `:undergoer` participant.

When the single participant of the intransitive corresponds to the
`:actor` role, then the causer receives the `:causer` annotation and the single participant retains its `:actor` label. This
can be seen in <a href="#3-2-1-1-2 (6)">(6)</a> from Falam Chin (King 2011:195) below.

**Applicatives.**  Peterson (2007) distinguishes between “valency-increasing” applicatives and “valency-rearranging” applicatives. In valency-rearranging applicatives, a participant is expressed as an oblique in the basic construction and expressed as a core argument in the applicative construction; they are generally associated with the increased saliency or topicality of the oblique participant. Therefore, these fit into the category of pragmatic valency alternations, and both the basic and applicative construction receive the same participant role
annotation. This can be seen in
<a href="#3-2-1-1-2 (7)">(7)</a> from Falam Chin (King 2011:240).

Whether the beneficiary, *Thangte*, is expressed as an oblique or a core argument, it is annotated as `:affectee`. Valency-increasing applicatives involve the addition of a participant, compared to the basic construction. Here, the added participant is
simply annotated with the appropriate semantic role. This can be seen in <a href="#3-2-1-1-2 (7c)">(7c)</a>-<a href="#3-2-1-1-2 (7d)">(7d)</a> from Sanapaná.

**Reflexives & Reciprocals** For reflexive and reciprocal constructions, the single participant is annotated with both of the semantic role labels which it is fulfilling in the construction. This can be seen in <a href="#3-2-1-1-2 (8a)">(8a)</a> and <a href="#3-2-1-1-2 (8b)">(8b)</a> from Supyire (Carlson 1994:416-7).

##### Part 3-2-1-2. Stage 1

The Stage 1 participant role annotation requires access to
PropBank-style frame files in the language for a large number of
predicates. At this stage, each predicate identified as an event is linked
to its corresponding frame file. The participants dependent on that
event are annotated with the lexicalized roles, as determined by the
frame file. This can be seen in <a href="#3-2-1-2 (1)">(1)</a> below.  

```
predicate: tease-02
	roles:
	ARG0: teaser
	ARG1: teased 
	ARG2: about what
```

<span id="3-2-1-2 (1)">3-2-1-2 (1)</span>

```
He teased the boy about his hat.

(t/ tease-02
	:ARG0 (p/ person
		:ref-person 3rd
		:ref-number Singular)
	:ARG1 (b/ boy
		:ref-number Singular)
	:ARG2 (h/ hat
		:poss b)
	:aspect Endeavor
	:modstr FullAff)
```

Since the non-verbal clause functions require the use of lexicalized predicates at Stage 0, these are annotated in the same way at Stage 1 (see [Part 3-2-1-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-1-non-verbal-clauses)). Unlike Stage 0, implicit participants are
annotated for their semantic role at Stage 1. This is shown in
<a href="#3-2-1-2 (2)">(2)</a>.

<span id="3-2-1-2 (2)">3-2-1-2 (2)</span> 
```
She parked the truck in the driveway. They loaded the boxes.

(s1p/ park-01
	:ARG0 (s1p2/ person
		:ref-person 3rd
		:ref-number Singular)
	:ARG1 (s1t/ truck
		:ref-number Singular)
	:ARG2 (s1d/ driveway)
	:aspect Performance
	:modstr FullAff) 

(s2l/ load-01
	:ARG0 (s2p/ person
		:ref-person 3rd
		:ref-number Plural)
	:ARG1 (s2t/ thing)  
	:ARG2 (s2b/ box
		:ref-number Plural)
	:aspect Performance
	:modstr FullAff)
(s2/ sentence
	:temporal (DCT :before s2l)
	:modal (AUTH :FullAff s2l)
	:coref (s1t :same-entity s2t))
```

The second sentence in <a href="#3-2-1-2 (2)">(2)</a> does not
include explicit mention of the truck, but it is understood from the
context that the truck is the goal participant of the loading event. Therefore, an implicit 'thing' participant is identified for the ```:ARG1``` role of the loading event at Stage 1. In the document-level annotation, this participant is then flagged as coreferential with the truck in the previous sentence.

###### Part 3-2-1-2-1. Valency alternations

The approach to valency alternations at Stage 1 is largely the same as
that detailed for Stage 0 in [Part 3-2-1-1-2](#part-3-2-1-1-2-valency-alternations). However, at Stage 1,
predicates with valency-changing morphology should have their own frame
files with lexicalized arguments. Therefore, the annotation of
participant roles for valency alternations is the same as that for other
types of predicates. The predicate is matched with its frame files and
the participants are annotated accordingly with numbered argument roles rather than predicate-general ones.

##### Part 3-2-1-3. Inverse participant roles

AMR, the predecessor of UMR, makes use of **inverse** participant roles for a number of different purposes, such as the annotation of events that function as modifiers of referring expressions (typically relative clauses or participles, see [Part 3-1-1-2](#part-3-1-1-2-processes-in-modification-and-reference)), the annotation of embedded interrogatives, and the annotation of participant nominalizations. These three uses of inverse participant roles are illustrated in <a href="#3-2-1-3 (1)">(1)</a>. The use of, for example, the `:ARG1-of` relation in <a href="#3-2-1-3 (1a)">(1a)</a>, which is the inverse of the numbered argument role `:ARG1`, allows us to maintain a single-rooted graph structure by embedding the *see*-event underneath the participant it modifies (*sweater*). Such event concept nodes which are linked to other concepts by means of inverse participant roles can then further take their own full argument structure annotation and attribute values for e.g. aspect. Such inverses of numbered argument roles also allow us to make use of PropBank framefiles as much as possible: by annotating *runner* in <a href="#3-2-1-3 (1c)">(1c)</a> as `(p/ person :ARG0-of r/ run-02)`, we can directly link this annotation to the existing lexicon rather than having to enter an ad-hoc object concept node `(r/ runner)`.

```

UMR expands upon this AMR system of inverse relations by adding inverses for the general (i.e. non-predicate-specific) participant roles to be used at stage 0 of the road map. So, in addition to having inverses of numbered participant roles, there are now also `:Actor-of` and `:Undergoer-of` roles, and analogues for each of the general participant roles described in table 9 in [Part 3-2-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-stage-0)). Example <a href="#3-2-1-3 (2)">(2)</a> below illustrates the use of the inverse `:Stimulus-of` role to annotate the same relative clause as in <a href="#3-2-1-3 (1a)">(1a)</a> above.

<span id="3-2-1-3 (2)">3-2-1-3 (2)</span> 

```
I bought the sweater that you saw.
(b/ buy-01
	:actor (p/ person
		:ref-person 1st
		:ref-number Singular)
	:theme (s/ sweater
		:Stimulus-of (s2/ see-01
			:experiencer (p2/ person
				:ref-person 2nd
				:ref-number Singular)
			:aspect State
			:modstr FullAff)
		:ref-number Singular)
	:aspect Performance
	:modstr FullAff)
```

One more context in which inverse participant roles are used is in the annotation of certain relations that are mostly thought of (and mostly expressed in languages) as nominal modification - specifically, kinship relations and certain other relational nouns, e.g. those designating functions within organizations. For the annotation of noun phrases like *my father*, or *the President of the University of New Mexico*, UMR uses a `(p/ person)` concept node as the top of the graph, connected with an inverse participant role to a non-verbal clause predicate (which can then take further argument roles to express other elements in the NP). The most general, coarse-grained non-verbal clause predicate to be used in such annotations is `have-role-91`, although more specific predicates (e.g. `have-rel-role-92, have-org-role-92`) for frequently encountered concrete relation types are also available. The rolesets used for their arguments are detailed in [Part 3-1-3-5](#part-3-1-3-5-non-verbal-clauses)). The use of these predicates in such annotations is illustrated in <a href="#3-2-1-3 (3)">(3)</a>.

##### Part 3-2-1-4. Table of verb meanings

Table 12 below contains the general participant role annotation for the microroles associated with 89 verb meanings. The verb meanings and microroles are from the Valency Patterns Leipzig project (ValPaL; Hartmann et al. 2013). For two verb meanings, WIPE and PEEL, the ValPaL data reflects distinct verb senses: a motion sense (ex: She wiped the crumbs from the table) and a change-of-state (COS) sense (ex: He wiped the table). 

As mentioned in [Part 3-2-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-stage-0), the single participant in a monovalent event can either be annotated as <span class="smallcaps">`actor`</span> or as <span class="smallcaps">`undergoer`</span>. This distinction depends on the amount of control that the single participant has in carrying out the event. For events that are more controlled by the participant ("active" events), the participant is annotated as <span class="smallcaps">`actor`</span>; for events that are less controlled by the participant ("inactive" events), the participant is annotated as <span class="smallcaps">`undergoer`</span>. Languages that reflect this distinction in their morphosyntax (i.e., languages with active alignment) do not always draw the distinction between active events and inactive events in the same place. There is, however, a cross-linguistic organization in terms of how languages with active alignment code these events in their morphosyntax.

The following semantic event classes reflect an ordering from most active to most inactive (Croft 2012; 2022).

Controlled activities (ex: run)  
Position events (ex: hang)  
Inherent properties (ex: short)  
Bodily actions (ex: cough)  
Change of state (ex: become ill)  
Transitory properties (ex: be ill)  
Uncontrolled activities (ex: fall)  

For the purposes of UMR, controlled activities, position events, inherent properties, and more controlled types of bodily actions (ex: laugh) are annotated with an <span class="smallcaps">`actor`</span> participant. Less controlled types of bodily actions (ex: cry) and the remaining semantic event classes are annotated with an <span class="smallcaps">`undergoer`</span> participant.

Annotators may use Table 12 as a reference point for annotating general participant roles for various semantic verb classes.

  #### Part 3-2-2. Non-participant role UMR relations
  
Apart from predicate-specific and general participant roles, UMR also has a set of relations that are mainly used to mark NP-internal relations, to mark some types of modifiers of predicates, and to make the meanings of certain natural language expressions computationally tractable. Most of those relations are inherited from AMR, but for some of them, there are some changes in their use.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

  ##### Part 3-2-2-1. Temporal relations

Some relations are used to describe entities in a standard, canonical form. This is the case for ```:calendar, :century, :day, :dayperiod, :decade, :era, :month, :quarter, :season, :time, :timezone, :weekday, :year,``` and ```:year2```. The use of these relations is exemplified in <a href="#3-2-2-1 (1)">(1)</a>.

<span id="3-2-2-1 (1)" label="3-2-2-1 (1)">3-2-2-1 (1)</span>

  ##### Part 3-2-2-2. Modifiers

Other relations mostly function to modify object concepts - they are often expressed in languages as modifiers of some sort within an NP. Semantically, modification relations in referring expressions come in two kinds: anchoring and typifying (Croft, to appear). Anchoring modifiers "situate the intended referent of the referring expression via reference to another object", in other words, they provide referential grounding for a referent expression. Many anchoring modification relations are construed in languages as possessive relations: ownership (which situates a referent via reference to its owner), part-whole relations (which situate a referent via reference to a larger entity it is a part of), and kinship relations (which situate a referent via reference to another person that has a particular kind of relation to them). As described in [Part 3-2-1-3](#part-3-2-1-3-inverse-participant-roles), kinship relations are annotated through the `have-rel-role-92` predicate, even when they are not predicated. For ownership and part-whole relations, UMR uses `:poss` and `:part` relations with the possessum or part as the parent and the possessor or whole as the daughter, as in <a href="#3-2-2-1 (1)">(1)</a>.

<span id="3-2-2-2 (1)" label="3-2-2-2 (1)">3-2-2-2 (1)</span> 

<span id="3-2-2-2 (1a)" label="3-2-2-2 (1a)">3-2-2-2 (1a)</span>

John's car

```
<span id="3-2-2-2 (1b)" label="3-2-2-2 (1b)">3-2-2-2 (1b)</span> 
```
Guitar strings
(s/ string
	:part (g/ guitar)
	:ref-number Plural)
```
Typifying modifiers, on the other hand, "enrich the referent description by subcategorizing it or selecting the quantity (cardinality, amount, proportion, piece) of the
category or type denoted by the head noun." For such modifiers, a high-level, coarse-grained relation `:mod` is available. For example, in <a href="#3-2-2-2 (2a)">(2a)</a>, the modifier *women* does not narrow down the reference of *magazine* to a specific identifiable instance, but rather to a subclass of magazines. It is therefore annotated with the `:mod` relation, as opposed to a phrase like *that woman's magazine*, where *woman* would be annotated with the `:poss` relation. The `:mod` relation additionally inherits some uses from UMR. It is used to annotate demonstrative determiners, and it is used to annotate property concept modifiers that do not have their own frame files. Those uses are exemplified in <a href="#3-2-2-2 (2b)">(2b)</a>-<a href="#3-2-2-2 (2c)">(2c)</a> A number of more fine-grained subtypes of the `:mod` relation are also available - `:age`, for indicating the age of referents as in <a href="#3-2-2-2 (2d)">(2d)</a>; `:group`, for indicating the membership of groups <a href="#3-2-2-2 (2e)">(2e)</a>; `:topic`, for indicating what a referent is about as in <a href="#3-2-2-2 (2f)">(2f)</a>, and `:medium` for indicating channels of communication, such as languages as in <a href="#3-2-2-2 (2g)">(2g)</a>.

##### Part 3-2-2-3. Circumstantial temporals and locatives

A number of relations serve to modify events rather than objects - they are used to annotate circumstantial locative and temporal information rather than participants. The `:direction` and `:path` relations are used to annotate cardinal directions and extended spatial paths, respectively, as in <a href="#3-2-2-3 (1a)">(1a)</a> and <a href="#3-2-2-3 (1b)">(1b)</a>. The `:duration` and `:frequency` relations, illustrated in <a href="#3-2-2-3 (1c)">(1c)</a>-<a href="#3-2-2-3 (1e)">(1e)</a>, are optionally used to annotate aspectual information that may be overtly present but that cannot be captured in the `:aspect` attribute - as clarified in [Part 3-3-1](#part-3-3-1-Aspect), the latter abstracts away from duration and frequency information.

<span id="3-2-2-3 (1)" label="3-2-2=3 (1)">3-2-2-3 (1)</span>

  ##### Part 3-2-2-4. Named entities

The relations `:name`, `:wiki`, and `:opX` are mostly used in the treatment of named entities. Whenever an entity is explicitly mentioned by name in the text to be annotated, it receives a `:name` relation, whose daughter is an `(n/ name)` node. This node then has as many numbered `:opX` relations as the number of words this name consists of, each of which takes one of these words as their daughter. In <a href="#3-2-2-3 (1e)">\[3-2-2-3 (1e)\]</a> above, for example, the `(n/ name)` concept corresponding to *New York City* takes an `:op1`, `:op1`, and `:op3` relation, one for each orthographic word. Named entities can also take a `:wiki` relation, whose daughter is the title of the Wikipedia page corresponding to the entity in question. Numbered `:opX` relations are also used as the daughters of various abstract concepts used for expressing relations between clauses or phrases (e.g. coordination), as in <a href="#3-2-2-4 (1)">(1)</a>.

  ##### Part 3-2-2-5. Quantification

The `:ord`, `:quant`, `:range`, `:scale`, `:unit`, and `:value` relations are used to annotate semantics of quantification, as illustrated in <a href="#3-2-2-5 (1)">(1)</a>. The `:ord` role is used to express ordinals. It always takes an `(o/ ordinal-entity)` concept as its daughter, which in turn takes a `:value` relation to express the ordinal position, as in <a href="#3-2-2-5 (1a)">(1a)</a>. It may furthermore take a `:range` relation to indicate a specific time period in which the relevant ordinal position holds, as in <a href="#3-2-2-5 (1b)">(1b)</a>. The `:value` relation is, apart from ordinals, used for annotating percentages, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and urls, as illustrated in <a href="#3-2-2-5 (1c)">(1c)</a> and <a href="#3-2-2-5 (1d)">(1d)</a>. The `:quant` relation is used for annotating both exact and approximate cardinalities of sets of countable objects as in <a href="#3-2-2-5 (1e)">(1e)</a> and <a href="#3-2-2-5 (1f)">(1f)</a>, as well as for the number of "units" of non-countable substances, as in <a href="#3-2-2-5 (1g)">(1g)</a>. This latter use includes temporal durations and spatial distances, as in <a href="#3-2-2-3 (1c)">\[3-2-2-3 (1c)\]</a> above. The `:unit` relation is used for both standardized, well-established units such as dollars in <a href="#3-3-2 (1a)">\[3-3-2 (1a)\]</a> below or weeks in <a href="#3-2-2-3 (1c)">\[3-2-2-3 (1c)\]</a> above, and for ad-hoc mensural constructions, such as cups in <a href="#3-2-2-5 (1g)">(1g)</a>. Lastly, the `:scale` relation is used for quantities where a `:quant 0` value does not actually represent a 0-quantity, such as on the Richter or Decibel scale, as in <a href="#3-2-2-5 (1h)">(1h)</a>.

  ##### Part 3-2-2-6. Other relations

The `:example` relation, illustrated in <a href="#3-2-2-6 (1a)">(1a)</a>, is used to annotate illustrative examples of object categories. The `:polite` relation is used to indicate that an utterance (often a command) is marked for deference with respect to the interlocutor, as in <a href="#3-2-2-6 (1b)">(1b)</a>. The `:li` relation is used to mark entities as entries on a bulleted list, as in <a href="#3-2-2-6 (1c)">(1c)</a>.

The `:condition` and `:concession` relations are alternative ways of annotating the `have-condition-91` and `have-concession-91` predicates - their use is detailed in [Part 4-3](#part-4-3-modal-dependency).

Lastly, annotators have at their disposal an `:other-role` relation, as already mentioned in table 5 in [Part 3-2-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-stage-0). If they encounter any concept that they believe needs to be included in the UMR annotation, but UMR does currently not have a defined procedure of annotating it, they may simply add it to the graph using this `:other-role` relation, linking it to the concept node that seems appropriate.

### Part 3-3. UMR attributes
  
#### Part 3-3-1. Aspect

The aspect annotation consists of a single value that is annotated for
every event identified in [Part 3-1-1](#part-3-1-1-eventive-concepts). The aspect annotation doesn’t
have distinct annotation stages, unlike modality and participant roles.
Instead it relies on a typological lattice which ranges from very
coarse-grained to very fine-grained aspectual values. It’s expected that
languages at an earlier stage of semantic analysis or annotation will
tend to use more coarse-grained values, and languages at later stages of
annotation will tend to use more fine-grained values.

This is also heavily dependent on the aspectual distinctions that are
grammaticalized and/or obligatory in the language. For example, although
English has a long history of semantic analysis and many computational
resources, it has very little overt aspectual marking in its grammar and
therefore the most fine-grained aspect distinctions are very difficult
to judge in annotation. This aspect lattice is shown below. 

![Aspect lattice](https://github.com/umr4nlp/umr-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines_figures/Aspect%20Lattice_2022.png)

Below are the aspect values with a brief definition.

```habitual```: occurs/occurred usually or habitually  
```imperfective```: ambiguous between state and atelic process  
```process```: unspecified type of process  
```atelic process```: process that does not reach a result state  
```perfective```: process that comes to an end  
```state```: unspecified type of state  
```reversible state```: acquired state that is not permanent  
```irreversible state```: acquired state that is permanent  
```inherent state```: state that is not acquired and permanent  
```point state```: state that is acquired and reversed at a single point in time  
```activity```: process that does not end  
```undirected activity```: process that does not end and does not progress linearly along a scale  
```directed activity```: process that does not end and does progress linearly along a scale  
```endeavor```: process that ends without reaching a result state  
```semelfactive```: process that ends without reaching a result state and happens at a single point in time  
```undirected endeavor```: process that ends without reaching a result state and does not progress linearly along a scale  
```directed endeavor```: process that ends without reaching a result state and progresses linearly along a scale  
```performance```: process that ends and  reaches a result state  
```incremental accomplishment```: process that ends and reaches a result state, and progresses linearly along a scale  
```nonincremental accomplishment```: process that ends and reaches a result state, and does not progress linearly along a scale  
```directed achievement```: process that ends and reaches a result state within a single point in time, and progresses linearly along a scale  
```reversible directed achievement```: process that ends and reaches a result state, which is not permanent, within a single point in time, and progresses linearly along a scale  
```irreversible directed achievement```: process that ends and reaches a result state, which is permanent, within a single point in time, and progresses linearly along a scale  

In order to select the appropriate annotation value for each event,
annotators proceed through a series of decisions.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

##### Part 3-3-1-1. Event Nominals

The first decision concerns the morphosyntactic expression of the event. Events expressed as nominals often lack any grammatical clues as to their aspectual structure. This makes determining an aspectual
annotation value difficult. We do, however, know that these events are
processes, and not states, since nominals expressing states are not
identified as events. On the lattice,
```process``` is the aspectual value that includes all types of processes. Therefore, events expressed as event
nominals, as in <a href="#3-3-1-1 (1)">(1)</a>, are annotated as
```process```.


<span id="3-3-1-1 (1)" label="3-3-1-1 (1)">3-3-1 (1)</span>

<span id="3-3-1-1 (1a)" label="3-3-1-1 (1a)">3-3-1-1 (1a)</span>
```
He presented his research at the meeting yesterday.
(p/ present-01
	:ARG0 (p2/ person
		:ref-person 3rd
		:ref-number Singular)
	:ARG1 (t/ thing
		:ARG1-of (r/ research-01
			:ARG0 p2))
	:place (m/ meet-01
		:aspect Process)
	:temporal (y/ yesterday)
	:aspect Performance
	:modstr FullAff)
```
<span id="3-3-1-1 (1b)" label="3-3-1-1 (1b)">3-3-1-1 (1b)</span>   
```
After the game, she went home.
(g/ go-01
	:ARG0 (p/ person
		:ref-person 3rd
		:ref-number Singular)
	:ARG4 (h/ home)
	:temporal (a/ after
		:op1 (g2/ game
			:aspect Process))
	:aspect Performance
	:modstr FullAff)
```
Any event packaged in a referring expression is considered an event
nominal and annotated with `process`. This
includes underived nominals, nominalizations, and gerunds, as in <a href="#3-3-1-1 (2)">(2)</a>.

<span id="3-3-1-1 (2)" label="3-3-1-1 (2)">3-3-1-1 (2)</span>

<span id="3-3-1-1 (2a)" label="3-3-1-1 (2a)">3-3-1-1 (2a)</span>   
```
The second training was cancelled yesterday.
(c/ cancel-01
	:ARG1 (t/ train-01
		:ord (o/ ordinal-entity
			:value 2)
		:aspect Process)
	:temporal (y/ yesterday)
	:aspect Performance
	:modstr FullAff) 
```
<span id="3-3-1-1 (2b)" label="3-3-1-1 (2b)">3-3-1-1 (2b)</span>   
```
The dog interrupted the meeting with his barking.
(i/ interrupt-01
	:ARG0 (d/ dog
		:ref-number Singular)
	:ARG1 (m/ meet-01
		:aspect Process)
	:manner (b/ bark-01
		:ARG0 d
		:aspect Process)
	:aspect Performance
	:modstr FullAff) 
```

Note that *-ing* forms in English can occur in a variety of
constructions; they should only be treated as event nominals when they
are used in referring expressions (as in <a href="#3-3-1-1 (2a)">(2a)</a> and
<a href="#3-3-1-1 (2b)">(2b)</a> above). When they occur in other types of
constructions, as in <a href="#3-3-1-1 (3)">(3)</a>, they should not
receive an aspect annotation at this point and annotators should
continue on to the next step.

<span id="3-3-1-1 (3)" label="3-3-1-1 (3)">3-3-1-1 (3)</span> The
dog stopped **barking** for a few seconds.

Event nominals that occur in predicate nominal constructions, as in
<a href="#3-3-1-1 (4)">(4)</a>, are also not annotated at this point;
these are treated like other predicate nominal constructions.

<span id="3-3-1-1 (4)" label="3-3-1-1 (4)">3-3-1-1 (4)</span>

It was **an earthquake**.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

##### Part 3-3-1-2. Habitual

The next step concerns the application of the
```habitual``` aspect value. This value should
be applied to all events that are presented as occurring usually or
habitually, as in <a href="#3-3-1-2 (1)">(1)</a>.


<span id="3-3-1-2 (1)" label="3-3-1-2 (1)">3-3-1-2 (1)</span>

<span id="3-3-1-2 (1a)" label="3-3-1-2 (1a)">3-3-1-2 (1a)</span> 
```
He bakes pies.

	:ARG1 (p2/ pie

	:aspect Habitual
	:modstr FullAff) 
```
<span id="3-3-1-2 (1b)" label="3-3-1-2 (1b)">3-3-1-2 (1b)</span>  
```
She rides her bike to work.

	:goal (w/ work-01
		:ARG0 p
		:aspect Process)
	:aspect Habitual
	:modstr FullAff)
```
<span id="3-3-1-2 (1c)" label="3-3-1-2 (1c)">3-3-1-2 (1c)</span>   
```
They vacation in Taos every winter.
(v/ vacation-01
	:ARG0 (p/ person

		:ref-number Plural)
	:ARG (c/ city
		:name (n/ name :op1 "Taos")
		:wiki "Taos_New_Mexico")
	:frequency (r/ rate-entity-91
		:ARG3 (t/ temporal-quantity
			:quant 1
			:unit (y/ year))
		:ARG4 (w/ winter))
	:aspect Habitual
	:modstr FullAff)  
```
<span id="3-3-1-2 (1d)" label="3-3-1-2 (1d)">3-3-1-2 (1d)</span>
```
They used to vacation in Taos every winter.
(v/ vacation-01
	:ARG0 (p/ person
		:ref-person 3rd
		:ref-number Plural)
	:ARG1 (c/ city
		:name (n/ name :op1 "Taos")
		:wiki "Taos_New_Mexico")
	:frequency (r/ rate-entity-91
		:ARG3 (t/ temporal-quantity
			:quant 1
			:unit (y/ year))
		:ARG4 (w/ winter))
	:aspect Habitual
	:modstr FullAff)   
```

In English, present habitual events are signalled by the Simple Present
construction; past tense habitual events are expressed with the *used
to* construction. Note that the ```habitual```
annotation is not used for ability modals (e.g., *he can bake apple
pie*); see example [3-3-1-3 (3)](#3-3-1-3 (3)) for handling ability modals.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)
##### Part 3-3-1-3. State

The next step assesses whether the event is a
```state```. The distinction between states and
processes is necessary for event identification (as states are only
identified as events when predicated, see [Part 3-1-1](#part-3-1-1-eventive-concepts)). According to Vendler (1967), states are those events which are stative—that is, no change takes place over the course of the event. There are various ways to express states in predication, shown in <a href="#3-3-1-3 (1)">(1)</a>; note that all of the non-verbal clause types identified in [Part 3-1-1-3](#part-3-1-1-3-states-and-entities) and annotated with UMR predicates are annotated as ```state```.

```

Modal verbs, as in <a href="#3-3-1-3 (2)">(2)</a>, and events under the scope of
ability modals, as in <a href="#3-3-1-3 (3)">(3)</a>, are also annotated as
```state```.

```
In this analysis, ability modals refer to a static state of affairs,
i.e. an entity possesses the relevant ability. For examples like
<a href="#3-3-1-3 (3a)">(3a)</a>, ability modals may look more like event
quantification. That is, there are probably multiple singing events that this example is generalizing over. Examples like <a href="#3-3-1-3 (3b)">(3b)</a>, however, show how ability modals are more like states. It is possible
that the car has never actually gone as fast as 150 mph; the car just
has the parts and (theoretical) ability to do so. Therefore, all types
of ability modals, both <a href="#3-3-1-3 (3a)">(3a)</a> and <a href="#3-3-1-3 (3b)">(3b)</a>, are
analyzed as states and annotated as such.

There is a type of event, called “inactive actions” by Croft (2012), which is semantically intermediate between states and processes. In many languages, they can be construed either way. For example, English *lie* can occur in the Progressive (*Bill **is lying** on the bed*) or the Simple Present (*The Sandias **lie** to the east of Albuquerque*). And across languages there is variation as to the default construal of
inactive actions. The most frequent inactive actions are posture verbs
(*sit, stand, lie, hang*), perception verbs (*see/look at, watch,
hear/listen to, feel*), some sensation verbs (*ache*), mental activity
verbs (*think, understand*), and verbs of operation/function (*work* in
*This washing machine **works/is working***). For the UMR annotation,
inactive actions in all constructions are annotated as
```state```. If it is unclear whether an event
refers to a ```state``` or an
```atelic process```, then the
```imperfective``` annotation value is used.

There are different types of states, shown in
<a href="#3-3-1-3 (4)">(4)</a>, which can optionally be distinguished in
the aspect annotation.

```

Events that are annotated as ```inherent
state```, as in <a href="#3-3-1-3 (4a)">(4a)</a>, refer to states that are
an inherent property of the entity, i.e. they did not ‘start’ at any
particular point in the entity’s history and are not changeable in the
future. Events annotated as ```reversible
state```, as in <a href="#3-3-1-3 (4b)">(4b)</a>, refer to properties of entities
that are not inherent, meaning they have come into existence at some
point during the entity’s history; these states are reversible, meaning
the entity likely will revert back to its base state in the future.
Events annotated as ```irreversible state```,
as in <a href="#3-3-1-3 (4c)">(4c)</a>, refer to properties of entities that are not
inherent, but cannot be reversed in the future; once acquired, these
states are permanent. Finally, events that are annotated as
```point state```, as in <a href="#3-3-1-3 (4d)">(4d)</a>,
refer to states that come into and out of existence over a single point
in time (what is considered a ‘point’ is open to construal); these
states necessarily do not persist into the future.

Events that are not annotated as a type of
```state``` move on to the next step.

##### Part 3-3-1-4. Activity

The ```activity``` label applies to processes
when there is no evidence that the event has come to an end, as in
<a href="#3-3-1-4 (1)">(1)</a>.

<span id="3-3-1-4 (1)" label="3-3-1-4(1)">3-3-1-4 (1)</span>

<span id="3-3-1-4 (1a)" label="3-3-1-4 (1a)">3-3-1-4 (1a)</span>

	:temporal (y/ yesterday)
	:aspect Activity
	:modstr FullAff)
```

This covers cases where it is clear that the process is still ongoing at
document creation time, as in <a href="#3-3-1-4 (1a)">(1a)</a>, but also cases
where it is ambiguous whether or not the process continues, as in
<a href="#3-3-1-4 (1b)">(1b)</a>.

This step is largely dependent on context and real world knowledge,
however there are some grammatical cues that can help. Events in the
present tense, as in <a href="#3-3-1-4 (2)">(2)</a>, are annotated as
```activity```.

<span id="3-3-1-4 (2)" label="3-3-1-4 (2)">3-3-1-4 (2)</span>   
```

(p/ play-01
	:ARG0 (p2/ person

	:ARG2 (v/ violin)
	:aspect Activity
	:modstr FullAff)
```

Inceptive and continuative aspectual marking, as in <a href="#3-3-1-4 (3)">(3)</a>,
also do not imply that an event has (necessarily) ended.

<span id="3-3-1-4 (3)" label="3-3-1-4 (3)">3-3-1-4 (3)</span>

<span id="3-3-1-4 (3a)" label="3-3-1-4 (3a)">3-3-1-4 (3a)</span>

```
If an annotator is unsure about whether the text indicates that an event has ended or not, the ```atelic process```
label can be used.

There are two finer-grained ```activity```
categories which can optionally be distinguished. Certain types of
activities describe directed change, as in
<a href="#3-3-1-4 (4)">(4)</a>, whereas other activities describe
undirected change, as in <a href="#3-3-1-4 (5)">(5)</a>;
these are annotated as ```directed activity```
and ```undirected activity``` respectively.


<span id="3-3-1-4 (4)" label="3-3-1-4 (4)">3-3-1-4 (4)</span>
```
The soup was cooling on the counter.
(c/ cool
	:ARG1 (s/ soup)

The cat was meowing outside the door.

	:ARG0 (c/ cat
		:ref-number Singular)
	:place (o/ outside
		:op1 (d/ door))
	:aspect Undirected Activity
	:modstr FullAff)
```

Events annotated as ```directed activity```
refer to change that occurs gradually along a qualitative scale. In
<a href="#3-3-1-4 (4)">(4)</a>, the temperature of the soup
continues to decrease in a linear fashion. Events annotated as
```undirected activity``` refer to change that
does not progress incrementally along a scale; in
<a href="#3-3-1-4 (5)">(5)</a>, there is no scale or gradual
change.

Events that have ended prior to document creation time and have not yet
received an annotation move on to the next step.

##### Part 3-3-1-5. Endeavor and Performance

At this point, only ```perfective``` events are
left: ```endeavor``` and
```performance```. Both the
```endeavor``` and
```performance``` aspectual types entail that
the process has come to an end; they are distinguished by the
boundedness of the event in terms of qualitative state. The
```performance``` value is used when the event
reaches a result state distinct from the base (start) state, that is, a specific “natural” endpoint. The ```endeavor```
value is used when the events ends, but does not reach a distinct result
state. The ```performance``` value can be seen
as the ‘default’ value for events at this step; the
```endeavor``` value is only annotated in the
presence of explicit marking, which may come in several forms detailed
below. If it’s not clear which category an event fits into, it can be
annotated as ```perfective```.

The explicit aspectual markings which suggest an
```endeavor``` annotation are terminative
aspect marking, durative adverbials, and non-result paths. These are
illustrated for English below.

Terminative aspectual marking, such as *stop* in English, is the
strongest evidence that an event has ended without reaching a result
state and should therefore be annotated as
```endeavor```. Durative adverbials, such as in
<a href="#3-3-1-5 (1b)">(1b)</a>, are the second strongest evidence for an
```endeavor``` annotation: they indicate that
the event took place for a defined period of time and then ended, likely
without completion. At least in English, durative adverbials cannot
co-occur with completive aspectual marking; see
<a href="#3-3-1-5 (1c)">(1c)</a>. A non-result path is the weakest evidence
for an ```endeavor``` annotation; in the
absence of other aspectual indicators, a non-result path requires an
```endeavor``` annotation, as in
<a href="#3-3-1-5 (1d)">(1d)</a>. But, if there is a completive aspectual marker,
as in <a href="#3-3-1-5 (1e)">(1e)</a>, or a container adverbial, as in
<a href="#3-3-1-5 (1f)">(1f)</a>, both indicators that an event has reached
a distinct result state, then the event is annotated as
```performance```.

In the absence of any of the aspectual indicators listed above, events
that have made it to this point in the decision tree are annotated as
```performance```.

Both ```endeavor``` and
```performance``` have more fine-grained
aspectual distinctions which may optionally be annotated. Endeavors may
be specified with ```undirected endeavor```,
```directed endeavor```, and
```semelfactive```. The
```undirected endeavor``` and
```directed endeavor``` values correspond to
```undirected activity``` and
```directed activity```; they differ in that
the event has come to an end. Semelfactives refer to punctual events
that happen once before reverting back to the base state (these are
similar to ```point state```, but refer to a
process), as in <a href="#3-3-1-5 (2c)">(2c)</a>.

The finer-grained annotations for
```performance``` distinguish between punctual
events (```directed achievement```) and durative
events (```incremental accomplishment```,
```nonincremental accomplishment```), with even
finer-grained categories based on the type of change.

Achievements are punctual events, meaning that they are conceptualized as
occurring at a single point in time (like ```point
state``` and ```semelfactive```). Unlike
```point state``` and
```semelfactive```, achievements don’t revert
back to the base state, which is why they’re considered a finer-grained
type of ```performance```. The
```directed achievement``` annotation can be
further specified based on whether the change is reversible or
irreversible. In <a href="#3-3-1-5 (3a)">(3a)</a>, the change that the door
undergoes can be reversed in that the door can be closed; therefore this
is annotated as ```reversible directed
achievement```. In <a href="#3-3-1-5 (3b)">(3b)</a>, the change that the
window undergoes cannot be reversed; therefore this is annotated as
```irreversible directed achievement```.

Accomplishments are durative events that can be categorized based on
whether the change occurs incrementally or nonincrementally; this is
similar to the difference between directed and undirected activities and
endeavors. With ```incremental
accomplishment```, the change occurs incrementally along the
qualitative dimension; in <a href="#3-3-1-5 (3c)">(3c)</a>, the pancake
is eaten piece-by-piece and each subsequent bite brings the event closer
to completion. With ```nonincremental
accomplishment```, the change ends up at a distinct result state (as
with all types of Performances), but it may not get there in a
linear/incremental fashion. In <a href="#3-3-1-5 (3d)">(3d)</a>,

#### Part 3-3-2. Mode

UMR adopts the `:mode` attribute from AMR. The values for the `:mode` attribute include:

```expressive```: used for exclamational words such as _hmm_, _wow_, _yup_ etc., which express emotion but don't clearly refer to events, objects or properties, as in <a href="#3-3-2 (1a)">(1a)</a>. This value is not used for mere emphasis, or for exclamation marks.

```imperative```: used for commands, as in <a href="#3-3-2 (1b)">(1b)</a>.

```interrogative```: used for both polar questions and content questions, as in <a href="#3-3-2 (1c)">(1c)</a>.

#### Part 3-3-3. Polarity
UMR mainly treats propositional negation at the document-level in the modal dependency annotation. However, the AMR attribute `:polarity` is also maintained in the UMR sentence-level annotation. It is used to flag any morphosyntactic indicators of negation that are present in the clause, as in <a href="#3-3-3 (1)">(1)</a>. These do not necessarily signal semantic negation. This is the case, for example, for some instances of derivational negation of adjectives in English.

#### Part 3-3-5. Ref
As opposed to AMR, which uses an English-based lexical treatment of pronominal reference, UMR approaches pronominal reference and person/number marking in a cross-linguistically motivated way. It annotates person and number through two attributes - `:ref-person` for grammatical person information, and `:ref-number` for grammatical number marking. These attributes can apply to any entity concept. If an explicit nominal is marked for plural or dual number, for instance, the node for this entity concept can take the relevant attribute value label, as in <a href="#3-3-5 (1)">(1)</a>.

<span id="3-3-5 (1)" label="3-3-5 (1)">3-3-5 (1)</span>

<span id="3-3-5 (1a)" label="3-3-5 (1a)">3-3-5 (1a)</span>

woman	that-3PL-EP-DU
'Those two women'

(a/ áine 'woman'
	:mod (ŋ/ ŋara 'that')
	:ref-number Dual)
```

For arguments expressed only through verbal cross-referencing, or arguments that are implicit, both `:ref-person` and `:ref-number` can be used to represent their pronominal features. In such cases where there is no overt nominal expression to attach those values to, UMR "hallucinates" a concept (typically a named-entity category, e.g. `person`, `thing`) to attach the attribute labels to in order to facilitate cross-lingual compatibility, as in <a href="#3-3-5 (2)">(2)</a>. In the context preceding this one-word sentence, the speaker talks about how upon first contact between the Sanapaná and Latinoparaguayans, the Paraguayans gifted the Sanapaná food and clothes. Here, the Sanapaná speaker describes the reaction of his ancestors to these gifts. From the prefixal indexation on the verb (2nd/3rd person masculine + distributive) and the preceding context (talking about the Sanapaná ancestors), we know that the `:actor` argument of the *eat*-verb is third person plural. Therefore, we annotate this argument with a `(p/ person)` concept, which in turn takes `:ref-person` and `:ref-number` attributes with the values `3rd` and `Plural`. The `:undergoer` of this predicate is not explicitly expressed at all, but from previous context we know it is the food that they were offered by the Paraguayans. We therefore annotate it with a `(t/ thing)` concept that will later in the document-level annotation be marked as coreferential with a mention of 'food' in the previous context.

	:aspect Performance

```

The possible values for the `:refer-person` attribute are based on Cysouw's (2003) cross-linguistic study of person-marking systems in the languages of the world. They are organized in a lattice as seen below. The default level of categories contains the well-known and familiar `1st`, `2nd`, and `3rd` person values. Some languages have more fine-grained person systems, distinguishing a first person `exclusive` from a first person `inclusive` value in non-singular numbers (depending on whether the interlocutor is included in the group that is being referred to). Other languages have more coarse-grained systems, making no distinction between first and second person, or between second and third person (like Sanapaná above).

![Person lattice](https://github.com/umr4nlp/umr-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines_figures/Person%20Lattice_2022.png)

The possible number values for the `:refer-number` attribute are based on Corbett (2000). The default level here consists simply of `singular` vs. `non-singular`. Languages with more fine-grained categories in their system may have more fine-grained `dual`, `trial`, `paucal`, and `greater plural` categories, which fit together as shown in the figure below.

#### Part 3-3-6. Degree
In AMR, markers of degree such as English _very_ (high degree of a scalar quality, as in _very cold_) and _somewhat_ (low degree of a scalar quality, as in _somewhat dirty_) are treated lexically - a `:degree` relation is added to the property concept that is admodified. However, in many languages, such degree expressions are morphological rather than periphrastic - they form a single word with the property concept word. Such a lexical treatment is hard for these languages. UMR therefore allows annotators to treat `:degree` as an attribute, with three possible values: `intensifier`, `downtoner`, and `equal`. These values can in this way be attached directly to the whole property concept word without the need for morphological decomposition, as shown in <a href="#3-3-6 (1)">(1)</a>. For languages with periphrastic degree expressions like English, the lexical entry for words such as _very_ and _somewhat_ can be constructed to include reference to which of the three degree values listed above it expresses. In that way, English annotations would be comparable to annotations in a language like Sanapaná.

## Part 4. Document-Level Representation
### Part 4-1. Coreference


Anaphoric expressions such as pronouns cannot be properly interpreted without identifying their referents. This is generally done by linking an anaphoric expression to a named entity, a process generally known as *coreference* in the field of NLP. Coreference is an established NLP task, and the goal here is to identify the most relevant types of coreference in the UMR framework.  

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

#### Part 4-1-1. Entity coreference

For the UMR corereference annotation, we first need to answer two questions. The first is what counts as an anaphorical expression. For UMR annotation, we focus on pronouns. The second question is what types of coreference relations we are considering. The most common type of coreference relations are *identity* relations, and we label such relations as *same*. Identity relations means two expressions have the same referent. In <a href="#4-1-1 (1)">(1)</a>, *he* refers to the same person as the person whose name is "Edmond Pope", and it is therefore annotated in the document-level representation with a `:same-entity` relation to the `s2p` node.

<span id="4-1-1 (1)" label="4-1-1 (1)">4-1-1 (1)</span>

The example in <a href="#4-1-1 (2)">(2)</a> shows how the `:subset-of` relation is used to relate mentions of sets of entities to mentions of entities belonging to such a set. For example, _we_ (`p3`) includes reference to two entities - the author/speaker of the sentence, and the person who is described as *possessive and controlling*. The pronoun _he_, given the constant `p2`, refers to one of these two entities. Therefore, in the document-level annotation, `p2` is annotated with a `:subset-of` relation to the `p3` node.

The `:subset-of` relation is also used to annotate the subset relations between two event mentions, with one referring to a subset of another, as is the case in <a href="#4-1-2 (3)">(3)</a>. Both the _arrest_ made in Germany and the one made in the Netherlands are subevents of the _arrests_ that were ordered by judge Fragnoli. Therefore, both the `s1a2` node and the `s1a3` node are annotated with a `:subset-of` relation to `s2a`.

### Part 4-2. Temporal Dependency

The temporal annotation in UMR is done at both the sentence level and the document level. For instance, a time expression that serves as the modifier of a predicate is annotated at the sentence level. In <a href="#4-2 (1)">(1)</a>, the time expression 
*April 1998* is annotated as a temporal modifier of the predicate *sign*. Likewise, the temporal relation between an event and its document creation time (DCT) is also annotated at the sentence level. In <a href="#4-2 (1)">(1)</a>, the temporal relation between *sign* and the DCT is annotated as `:temporal (b2 /before :op (n/now))`. The temporal relation between an event and a time expression is annotated when a time expression is present in the sentence. The temporal relation between an event and the DCT is annotated when this temporal relation is defined in that context. For example, while the relation between *signed* and the DCT is clearly defined, the temporal relation between *fight* and the DCT is not.

In addition to temporal relations at the sentence level, we also annotate temporal relations at the document level.
The document-level temporal relations focus on event-event and time-time relations. Time-time relations are annotated when 
a relative time depends on another time expression for its interpretation.

Event-event relations are annotated only when the temporal relations are clearly supported by morpho-syntactic clues or when there is a clear temporal sequence can be inferred. 

The temporal dependency is divided into two passes: the first pass involves setting up the temporal
superstructure – the top levels of the dependency structure - and the second
pass involves adding events to the temporal dependency structure. The temporal superstructure contains the temporal expressions (timexs) in the text and pre-defined metanodes and their temporal relations to each other; the rest of the temporal dependency contains the events and their temporal relations to timexs and other events.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

#### Part 4-2-1. Nodes in the temporal dependency

There are three types of nodes in the temporal dependency structure: pre-defined metanodes, time expressions, and events. Pre-defined metanodes and time expressions make up the top levels of the dependency structure, called the temporal superstructure. `:depends-on` is the relation that is used to link all nodes in the temporal superstructure.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

##### Part 4-2-1-1. Pre-defined metanodes

Pre-defined metanodes are nodes that are present at the top of every temporal dependency structure, connected directly to the `ROOT` node. There are four pre-defined metanodes: `PAST_REF`, `PRESENT_REF`, `FUTURE_REF`, and `DCT` (document creation time). Unlike time expressions, the pre-defined metanodes don’t correspond to linguistic material in the text.  As mentioned
above, there is a generic `:depends-on` relation between all nodes
in the temporal superstructure.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

##### Part 4-2-1-2. Time expressions

The other type of node in the temporal superstructure are time
expressions. Annotators should identify all time expressions in a document and add them to the temporal superstructure before annotating events.

Time expressions are broken down into a taxonomy that
determines their representation in the temporal superstructure (see
Table 1 in Zhang & Xue (2018), reproduced here in Table 13.

<table>
<tr>
<th colspan="4"> Taxonomy</th>
<th> Examples</th>
<th> Possible Reference Times</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="5"> Time Expressions </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="3"> Locatable Time Expressions </td>
<td rowspan="2"> Concrete </td>
<td> Absolute</td>
<td> May 2015</td>
<td> ROOT </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Relative</td>
<td> today, two days later </td>
<td> DCT, another Concrete </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"> Vague</td>
<td> nowadays</td>
<td> Present/Past/Future_Ref </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3"> Unlocatable Time Expressions</td>
<td> every month </td>
<td>  -- </td>
</tr>
</table>

First, time expressions are distinguished based on whether they are
locatable on a timeline or not. Unlocatable time expressions are time
expressions which refer to the duration (*for three hours*) or
quantification (*every day*) of an event. Unlocatable time expressions
are not represented in the temporal dependency structure at any level. They do influence the aspect annotation, however (see [Part 3-3-1](#part-3-3-1-Aspect)).

<!-- (they do influence the aspect annotation; see §[3](#aspectannotation)) -->

All locatable time expressions are represented in the temporal
superstructure. Locatable time expressions are divided between concrete
and vague time expressions. Vague time expressions (e.g. *nowadays, in
the old days*) are represented as the children of `PRESENT_REF`,
`PAST_REF`, or `FUTURE_REF`. Concrete time expressions
are divided into relative and absolute time expressions. Relative
concrete time expressions (*yesterday, the week before*) are represented
as the children of either `DCT` (as in *yesterday*) or
another concrete time expression on which they depend for their
interpretation (as in *the week before*). Finally, absolute concrete
time expressions (*in 2019*) are represented as children of
`ROOT`.

#### Part 4-2-2. Temporal relations

#### Part 4-2-2-1. Choosing the right temporal relation

Once time expressions have been identified and annotated in the temporal dependency, annotators select temporal relations for the events in a text (see [Part 3-1-1](#part-3-1-1-eventive-concepts) for event ID guidelines). Each event is annotated as the child of either a time
expression in the superstructure or another event (or both). The set of
temporal relations are shown below. Note that the labels characterize
the relation from child to parent.

`:contained`: child is entirely contained within the parent; parent begins before child and parent ends after child (Note: this is called ‘Includes’ in Zhang & Xue 2018).

`:after`: child is after parent.  

`:before`: child is before parent.

`:overlap`: child and parent overlap (either partially or fully).  

The goal of this temporal annotation scheme is to give each event the
most precise temporal location possible. We also want to avoid adding
annotations which do not give any additional information (i.e., the
relation falls out logically from the other annotations). Follow the steps below to determine the most accurate and precise reference time for each event (but see [Part 4-2-2-1-1](#part-4-2-2-1-1-special-cases) below for exceptions) . All events need to receive at least one temporal annotation, but may receive two in cases where an event needs to be linked to both a time expression and another event.

1. If there is a time expression in the same line as the event, link the event to it with the proper relation (although see exception below). If the event does not receive an annotation at this step, proceed to step 2. If an event does receive an annotation at this step, proceed to step 4.

	 - **Exception:** The only scenario in which an event which has a clear temporal
        relation with a time expression doesn’t need to have this relation
        annotated is when the relation logically falls out from other
        annotations. This is the case when an event is `:contained` in another event, which itself is 
	`:contained` in a time expression. That is, if
        event A is `:contained` within event B (i.e., a
        subevent) and event B is `:contained` within a time expression,
        then logically, event A must also be `:contained`
        within the time expression and therefore this relation doesn’t need to be
        annotated.

2. At this point, consider time expressions in other lines in the text. If the event has a `:contained` relation to 	any time expression in the text, annotate that relation. Note that the same exception applies here as in 1. If an event doesn't receive an annotation at this step, proceed to step 3. If an event does receive an annotation at this step, proceed to step 4.

3. If an event is not linked to a time expression, then the next best reference time is another event in the text.  Good reference time events (i.e., parents in the temporal dependency) meet all of the criteria listed below. Often, the most appropriate parent is the event in the immediately preceding line or clause. Starting with the immediately preceding event in the text and working back through the events in the preceding lines, find an event that is a good parent. If there isn't a good parent event in the text, proceed to step 5. Otherwise, the temporal annotation for the event is complete.

	a. The parent event is a Process (or finer-grained subtype) in the Aspect annotation
	
	b. The parent event has a compatible modal annotation:
		the parent event and child event have the same parent and the same edge value in the modal dependency OR
		the parent event has a `:FullAff` relation to the `AUTH` node in the modal dependency
		
	c. There is a clear temporal relation between the parent event and the child event

4. If an event does get a relation to a time expression, a second annotation that specifies its relationship with another event may also be added. This is the case when a set of events are all `:contained` within the same time expression. The first event in the set of events only needs to be linked to the time expression. Subsequent events can receive two temporal annotations: one that relates it to the time expression and one that relates it to another event in the set.

5. Finally, if the event cannot be linked to either a time expression nor another event, then link it to the appropriate tense metanode.

```


The first event in this excerpt (`s15g`) is linked to a tense metanode, as there are no time expressions in the clause and there are no previous events in the excerpt. The next event (`s16d`) is linked to the immediately preceding event in the text (`s15g`) because it fits all of the criteria for a good reference time: its aspect annotation is a type of Process, it has a FullAff relation to the `AUTH` node, and there is a clear temporal relation between the two events. In a similar way, `s17h` is linked to `s16d`. For the final event in the excerpt (`s18d`), the previous event in the text does not make a good reference time. Since `s17h` is a State (not a Process), it does not fit the criteria for a good reference time. Therefore, `s18d` is linked to the next event back in the text `s16d`.



##### Part 4-2-2-1-1. Special cases

There are certain types of modal constructions that require special treatment in the temporal annotation. Events that are related in the modal dependency are generally related in the temporal dependency as well. The rest of this section covers event-event relations; when time expressions are present in the text, those temporal relations should be annotated in addition to the ones described below.



**Complement-taking predicates**

Events that are linked with a `:modpred` relation in the sentence-level modal annotation should also be linked in the temporal dependency. The complement-taking predicate acts as the reference time for its complement. That is, the complement is the child of the complement-taking predicate in the temporal dependency. There can be various types of temporal relations between complement-taking predicates and their complements, shown in <a href="#4-2-2-1-1 (1)">(1)</a>-<a href="#4-2-2-1-1 (3)">(3)</a>.

In cases where there are multiple complements of the same predicate, the annotator must consider whether the complements are ordered with respect to each other. When they are ordered, only one complement is annotated as the child of the main predicate in the temporal dependency. The remaining complement(s) are then linked to other complements in whichever way most fully specifies their temporal ordering. The complement which is closest in time to the main predicate is the one that is linked to the main predicate.

The complement-taking predicate itself follows the same process as other events (see [Part 4-2-2-1](#part-4-2-2-1-choosing-the-right-temporal-relation)) in order to select its reference time (i.e., its parent in the temporal dependency).


**Reporting events**

Reporting events are treated similarly to complement-taking predicates. Generally, reported events are linked to the reporting predicate with the appropriate temporal relation. When there are multiple reported events, annotators consider if they are ordered with respect to each other. In all cases, at least one of the reported events must be linked to the reporting predicate. Other reported events may be linked to each other or to the reporting predicate.


In <a href="#4-2-2-1-1 (5)">(5)</a>, both the arriving event and the eating event occur before the saying event. Since there is a clear ordering of the arriving event before the eating event, only one of these events is linked to the saying event. The eating event is closer in time to the saying event, and therefore the eating event is linked to the saying event in the temporal dependency. The arriving event is then linked to the eating event. (The fact that the arriving event also occurred before the saying event logically falls out from the annotations.) Finally, since the meeting event occurs after the saying event, the meeting event is also linked to the saying event.

**Purpose clauses**

Events in purpose clauses (i.e., annotated with a `:purpose` relation at the sentence level) are linked to the event in the main clause in the temporal dependency. The temporal relation between the event in the purpose clause and the main clause event is always `:after`.

##### Part 4-2-2-2. Contained or Overlap

Following the definition of the `:contained` and the
`:overlap` relations, `:overlap` must be used rather
than `:contained` for events that are perfectly simultaneous
(beginning and ending at the exact same time point). The
`:contained` relation will instead be used for all relations
where both the beginning and ending of one event are included within the
temporal duration of a second event - this includes subevent structure
and also events which have a purely temporal (and not causal or
conceptual) relation between them.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

##### Part 4-2-2-3. Causally-related events

Causal relations between events are always annotated as
`:after` relations. This means that in examples such as *the
crops grew well because it rained enough*, `(rain :after grow)`
is annotated even though the causing event (raining) and the caused
event (growing) partly overlap. If the causal relationship is explicitly
predicated, it is identified as a separate event. It is then annotated
as `:after` the causing event, and the caused event is
annotated as following it. Therefore, *the opening of the food can
prompted my cat to meow* is annotated as `(open :after prompt)`
and `(prompt :after meow)`.

<!-- 1.  The term “event” is used throughout these guidelines as a
    superordinate category subsuming processes and states, as is
    customary in the cognitive linguistic tradition. The more specific
    category of telic processes (which is also often called “event” in
    the formal semantics literature), we will refer to as “performance”
    (see §[3](#aspectannotation)). 2.  We are considering using the <span>NA</span> value for non-real
    events as well, but for now, these types of events should receive
    one of the other aspect values. -->

### Part 4-3. Modal Dependency

UMR represents modal strength and polarity as a dependency structure.
The nodes are either events or conceivers (i.e., a source, an entity
whose perspective on an event is modelled in the text). The edges in the dependency structure correspond to modal strength and polarity values (i.e., how certain a specific conceiver is about the occurrence of the event in the real world). Annotators do not have to construct the dependency structure directly, but it can be built up “behind the
scenes” by annotating some modal/polarity information and leveraging
the participant role annotation.

The modal annotation captures the modal strength of events, but not the modal type of the event (i.e., epistemic/evidential, deontic,
permissive, etc.). These modal strengths are annotated based on a
lattice of annotation values that differ in terms of granularity. An
example of the UMR annotation and the underlying modal dependency
structure is shown below in <a href="#4-3 (1)">(1)</a>.

<span id="4-3 (1)" label="4-3 (1)">4-3 (1)</span>

		   (s1s :before s1a))
	:modal ((AUTH :FullAff s1p)
		(AUTH :FullAff s1s)
		(s1p :PrtAff s1a)))
```

The *say*-event and the *arrive*-event each get a modal strength value (`:modstr`), which can then be represented
in the dependency as an edge between the event and the relevant conceiver/source. The
`:quot` value indicates than an event is
being reported, and the participant role annotation can be used to
automatically select the conceiver for the reported event(s), here,
*Martin*.

This simplified, mostly sentence-level, annotation process is step 0 of the road map for modal annotation. Step 1 builds on this step to end up at a fully specified modal dependency structure. This means that Stage 1 annotation involves first doing the Stage 0 modality annotations. (This contrasts with participant roles, where annotators can largely ignore Stage 0 if the annotation language has existing frame files.)

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

#### Part 4-3-1. Stage 0

There are two types of modal annotations at Stage 0: a
`:modstr` annotation that consists of a
single epistemic strength/polarity value, and a dependency annotation
that indicates a relation between two events. There are two dependency
relations: `:modpred` for the link between a
modal event and the event(s) that it modalizes, and
`:quot` for the link between a reporting
event and the event(s) that it reports. Additionally, events in purpose clauses and events in conditional constructions must be taken up in the modal dependency tree. The right structure of the modal dependency graph for these events will be extrapolated from the sentence-level annotation: events in purpose clauses are daughters of events in the main clause they depend on, and are connected to them with the `:purpose` participant role. This can be leveraged to embed the purpose-event underneath the correct parent in the modal dependency graph as well. For conditionals, similarly, the protasis event will be embedded under the apodosis event with a `:condition` relation, or the protasis and apodosis events will both be ```:ARG1``` and ```:ARG2``` of a `have-condition-91` node. Again, this information will be taken up in the eventual modal dependency graph without annotators needing to indicate it a second time in the document-level modal annotation workflow.
The `:modstr` annotation applies to all events, except for those under the scope of a modal identified as its own event (i.e., events with `:mod` relations). This
is summarized below.

<div id="tab:modal_relations">

| **Event type** | **UMR Treatment** |
| :------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Events under the scope of modals | `:modpred` relation to CPT |
| Events under the scope of reporting events| `:modstr` annotation, `:quot` relation to reporting event |
| All other events | `:modstr` annotation |

##### Part 4-3-1-1. modstr values

The modal strength values correspond to epistemic strength, i.e. the
author or conceiver’s certainty about the occurrence of the event in the real world, or certainty about another conceiver’s mental content. Based on Boye (2012), a typological study of modal systems across languages, and following FactBank (Pustejovsky et al. 2005), the UMR annotation is based around three levels of modal strength: `Full`, `Partial`, and `Neutral`, illustrated in <a href="#4-3-1-1 (1)">(1)</a>.

<span id="4-3-1-1 (1)" label="4-3-1-1 (1)">4-3-1-1 (1)</span>

<span id="4-3-1-1 (1a)" label="4-3-1-1 (1a)">4-3-1-1 (1a)</span> Full:  
The cat already **ate** breakfast.

<span id="4-3-1-1 (1b)" label="4-3-1-1 (1b)">4-3-1-1 (1b)</span>
Partial:  
The cat <u>probably</u> already **ate** breakfast.  

<span id="4-3-1-1 (1c)" label="4-3-1-1 (1c)">4-3-1-1 (1c)</span>
Neutral:  
The cat <u>might</u> have already **eaten** breakfast.

The `Full` modal strength value, as in <a href="#4-3-1-1 (1a)">(1a)</a>, corresponds to complete certainty; that is, the conceiver is 100% certain that the event occurs in the real world. The `Neutral` modal strength value, shown in <a href="#4-3-1-1 (1c)">(1c)</a>, indicates the possibility of the event; essentially, this corresponds to 50/50 certainty that the event occurs in the real world. The `Partial` modal strength value, as in <a href="#4-3-1-1 (1b)">(1b)</a>, falls between the `Full` and `Neutral` values; the conceiver believes that more likely than not, the event occurs in the real world.

But, `Full`, `Partial`, and `Neutral` aren’t the only possible modal strength annotation values. Languages differ in the modal strength distinctions that are conventionalized in their grammar. In order to accommodate these differences, we use a typological lattice of annotation values, constructed based on the structure of the annotation category across languages (Van Gysel et al. 2019).

One level of granularity in the lattice is designated as the “base
level”: annotators are encouraged to use categories from this level as
the default. These values are selected as the base level because these
distinctions occur the most frequently across languages. The higher and lower levels, respectively, contain equally typologically-motivated coarser-grained and finer-grained categories, which can be used when a language conventionalizes these distinctions in its grammar. Such lattices capture the idea that many semantic categories are structured as hierarchical scales, where the middle values can group together with either end, but the extremes of the scale are highly unlikely to be categorized together in any language. For example, no language has a grammatical form that is used for both `Full` and `Neutral` epistemic strength, but not `Partial`. The typological lattice for epistemic strength is shown below.

![Modal strength lattice](https://github.com/umr4nlp/umr-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines_figures/Affirmative%20Modal%20Strength%20Lattice_2022.png)

![Modal strength lattice](https://github.com/umr4nlp/umr-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines_figures/Negative%20Modal%20Strength%20Lattice_2022.png)

This lattice is based around the base level of `Full` vs. `Partial` vs.
`Neutral`, but also allows for the annotation of more coarse-grained
values that lump together the distinctions in the base level, and more
fine-grained annotation values. For contexts where it is unclear if the modal strength is `Full` or `Partial`, the `Non-neutral` value can be used; if it is unclear whether the modal strength is `Partial` or `Neutral`, then the `Non-full` value can be used. The most fine-grained modal strength values are generally used with languages that have grammatical forms that encode the relevant distinction.

Also following FactBank (Pustejovsky et al. 2006), the `:modstr`
annotation combines the epistemic strength values with a binary polarity distinction (`Affirmative`, `Negative`). This results in six modal strength/polarity values for the default level, shown below. Both the affirmative values and the negative values have their own set of related coarse-grained and fine-grained values.

<div>

| **Label**                              | **Value**                              |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| ```FullAff```     | full strength, affirmative polarity    |
| ```PrtAff```     | partial strength, affirmative polarity |
| ```NeutAFf```    | neutral strength, affirmative polarity |
| ```NeutNeg``` | neutral strength, negative polarity    |
| ```PrtNeg```  | partial strength, negative polarity    |
| ```FullNeg```    | full strength, negative polarity       |

</div>

These values and their interpretation are shown below; the corresponding FactBank values are in parentheses.

```FullAff```: full affirmative support; complete certainty that the event occurs (CT+)  
```PrtAff```: partial affirmative support; there is strong, but not definitive certainty that the event occurs (PR+)  
```NeutAff```: affirmative neutral support; there is neutral certainty that the event occurs/doesn’t occur; event is expressed positively (PS+)  
```NeutNeg```: negative neutral support; there is neutral certainty that the event occurs/doesn’t occur; negation of event is expressed (PS-)  
```PrtNeg```: partial negative support; there is strong but not definitive certainty that the event does not occur (PR-)  
```FullNeg```: full negative support; complete certainty that the event does not occur (CT-)

Degree of certainty corresponds most straightforwardly to the degree of confidence of a conceiver (often, the author) in the occurrence of an episodic event, i.e. the epistemic continuum from certainty to
possibility. We use these same values for the evidential continuum from direct evidence to second-hand (reported or inferred) evidence; see [Part 4-3-1-1-2](#part-4-3-1-1-2-evidential-justification) below). And these values are
interpreted into the domain of future-oriented or deontic modality, as
explained in [Part 4-3-1-1-3](#part-4-3-1-1-3-future-events-and-deontic-modality). The interpretation of
the value - as epistemic, evidential or deontic - is not reflected in
the modal strength annotation.

##### Part 4-3-1-1-1. Non-future events

For non-future (non-deontic) events, the `modstr` values correspond to the author’s level of certainty towards the occurrence of the event in the real world. Events presented as fact are annotated with
`FullAff`, while events for which the author categorically denies their occurrence are annotated `FullNeg`. When the author doesn’t present the
event as fact, but has a higher level of certainty towards the event
either being true or not true, this is annotated as
`PrtAff` or, when the polarity is negative, `PrtNeg`. When the author doesn’t lean either direction towards the event being true in the real world or not, the event is annotated as `NeutAff` or
`NeutNeg`, depending on the polarity of the
linguistic expression. These strength values are exemplified in

##### Part 4-3-1-1-2. Evidential justification

Following Boye (2012) and Saurí and Pustejovsky (2009), we conflate evidential justification with epistemic support. Boye (2012) finds that there is cross-linguistic evidence for lumping epistemic support and evidential justification together into the same relations. Languages may encode direct evidential justification (sensory perception) with the same forms as full epistemic support; indirect justification (hearsay, inferential) may be encoded by the same forms as partial epistemic support.

Example <a href="#4-3-1-1-2 (1)">(1)</a> shows how direct and indirect justification correspond to epistemic support.

<span id="4-3-1-1-2 (1)" label="4-3-1-1-2 (1)">4-3-1-1-2 (1)</span>

In <a href="#4-3-1-1-2 (1a)">(1a)</a>, the author has direct knowledge of the feeding event, by way of witnessing it. Therefore, *feed* is annotated with `Aff` modal strength. In <a href="#4-3-1-1-2 (1b)">(1b)</a>, however, *must* signals that the author is inferring that the feeding event occurred without direct, perceptual knowledge. Therefore, *fed* in <a href="#4-3-1-1-2 (1b)">(1b)</a> is annotated with `Prt` modal strength.

##### Part 4-3-1-1-3. Future events and deontic modality

For events presented as (potentially) happening in the future,
`:modstr` refers to the predictability of
the occurrence of the event in the future, as presented by the author.
Predictive future has full strength (`FullAff`
or `FullNeg`); intentions and commands
correspond to partial strength (`PrtAff` or
`PrtNeg`); and desire and permission
correspond to neutral (`NeutAff` or
`NeutNeg`) strength. Keep in mind that events under the scope of modals identified as their own event don't receive any `:modstr` value at all. This section refers to deontic meanings indicated by grammaticalized modals that don't fit the criteria to be identified as events.

This is illustrated in <a href="#4-3-1-1-3 (1)">(1)</a>.

The predictive future, as in <a href="#4-3-1-1-3 (1a)">(1a)</a>, is annotated with
full modal strength because it presents the future event as a certainty
(i.e., it is as certain as is possible for future events). Commands, as
in <a href="#4-3-1-1-3 (1b)">(1b)</a>, are annotated with partial modal strength
because they present the future event as less likely than the predictive
future, but more likely to happen than the neutral strength deontics.
Finally, permission, as in <a href="#4-3-1-1-3 (1c)">(1c)</a>, is annotated as
neutral strength, since even if someone has permission to do something, there is no guarantee they will.

Note that the modal itself is annotated with a
`:modstr` value (if it is not under the
scope of another modal). The actual modal value imparted by the modal
event is not annotated at Stage 0. It will be taken up in the lexical entries of modal complement-taking predicates and space-builders as the lexicon is being built, and will then automatically replace the unspecified link between the modal event and the modalized event in the document-level structure.

##### Part 4-3-1-3. quot relation

Events under the scope of a reporting predicate or a speech predicate
are annotated with a `:quot` relation to the
reporting or speech predicate. Unlike events under the scope of modals,
these events are also annotated with a
`:modstr` value.

As can be seen above, both the reporting predicate and the reported
events are annotated with a `:modstr` value.
The `:modstr` value of the reporting
predicate corresponds to the author’s certainty that the reporting event
happened. The `:modstr` value associated
with the reported events corresponds to the certainty with which the
sayer/reporter reports the events. For example, in
<a href="#4-3-1-3 (1d)">(1d)</a>, the author is certain about the saying event,
so it is annotated with `Aff`; but Mary is
unsure about the reality of the going event, and therefore it is
annotated with `Neut` modal strength.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

##### Part 4-3-1-4. purpose relation

Events in purpose clauses are annotated with both a
`:modstr` value in the document-level annotation, and with the `:purpose` participant role relation to the main clause event in the sentence-level annotation.

	:modal ((AUTH :FullAff s1w)
		(AUTH :FullAff s1p)
		(s1p :PrtAff purpose)
		(purpose :FullNeg s1a)))
```

The `:modstr` value represents any modals or
negation that are present within the purpose clause. That is, this value
doesn’t capture the fact that the purpose clause itself imparts a
non-full epistemic stance on its events; that is captured by the
`:purpose` relation.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

##### Part 4-3-1-5. condition relation

The `:condition` relation in the sentence-level annotation indicates the relationship between events in conditional constructions. These events
also receive a `:modstr` annotation. As can
be seen in <a href="#4-3-1-5 (1)">(1)</a>, the event in the protasis is annotated with a `:condition` relation to the event in the
apodosis.

<span id="4-3-1-5 (1)" label="4-3-1-5 (1)">4-3-1-5 (1)</span>

	:modal ((AUTH :NeutAff have-condition)
		(have-condition :FullNeg s1h)
		(have-condition :FullAff s1c))) 
```
As with purpose clauses, the `:modstr` value
doesn’t capture the uncertainty imparted by the conditional construction
itself; it corresponds to any negation or modals which are expressed
inside of the conditional construction. The modal value of the
conditional construction is captured by the
`:condition` value.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

##### Part 4-3-1-6. Modal dependency structure

At Stage 0, there are some pieces of the modal dependency structure that
are unspecified. The modal strength that a modal verb imparts on its
complement is one of these pieces. As the modal annotation progresses,
this information is added to the frame files for modal verbs. For
example, the complements of English *want* have a
`:modstr NeutAff` value; this will be indicated
in the frame file as shown below.

```
Predicate: want.01 
	Roles:  
	Arg0: wanter  
	Arg1: thing wanted  
	Arg2: beneficiary  
	Arg3: in-exchange-for  
	Arg4: from 

:modstr of complement: NeutAff  
```

For the complements of modals, the `:modstr`
values work largely the same way that they do for other events; however,
they reflect the beliefs of the
`:experiencer` participant of the modal
event, who is often not the author. For example, in
<a href="#4-3-1-6 (1)">(1)</a>, Mary believes that the visit event may take
place in the future (`NeutAff` strength), but
the author disagrees.

<span id="4-3-1-6 (1)" label="4-3-1-6 (1)">\[4-3-1-6 (1)\]</span> Mary wants
to visit France next month, but I don’t think that’s possible.

The value associated with the modal event in its frame file corresponds
to Mary’s beliefs, as the `:experiencer` of
the wanting event.

Some predicates impart full, positive
(`FullAff`) strength on their complements,
often called factive predicates (e.g., *manage to*). Strong epistemic
modals (e.g., *expect that, deduce*) and strong deontic modals,
including intention modals (e.g., *plan to, decide to*) and obligation
modals (e.g., *need, demand*), impart `PrtAff`
strength on their complements. Weak deontic modals, including desire
(e.g., *want*) and permission (e.g., *allow*), impart
`NeutAff` strength on their complements.
Certain modals may also lexicalize negation, such as *doubt*, *forbid*,
or *wish*. These are annotated with the
`NeutNeg`,
`PrtNeg`, and
`FullNeg` values, respectively.

[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

#### Part 4-3-2. English modals

This list gives the modal strength value associated with common English
modal constructions (this is certaintly not an exhaustive list). For
modal predicates that are identified as their own event (e.g.,
deontic predicates), the modal strength value characterizes the dependency link between the modal predicate node and its child event. For example, *want* is in the `NeutAff` list, which indicates that there
is a `NeutAff` link between the `want` node and its
complement event node in the full dependency structure.   

`FullAff` (full affirmative)

  - Simple assertions: declarative sentences

  - Certainty: *certainly, be sure, definitely, necessarily*

  - Predictive future: *will,* non-intentional *be going to*

  - Factual predicates: *manage to, finished*

`PrtAff` (partial affirmative)

  - Strong epistemic modals: *must/must have, have to, expect that,
    deduce*

  - Strong epistemic adverbs/adjectives: *probably/be probable that,
    likely/be likely that*

  - Strong deontic modals:
    
      - Intention: *intend, plan,* intentional *be going to, decide, be
        slated to*
    
      - Obligation: imperative, deontic *must, have to, should, ought
        to, be required to, need; order to, tell to, demand*
    
      - Purpose clauses/purposive event nominals: *(in order) to* VERB,
        *for* EVENT.NOM

`NeutAff` (neutral affirmative)

  - Weak epistemic modals: *may, might/might have, could have*

  - Weak epistemic adverbs/adjectives: *maybe, possibly/be possible
    that*

  - Conditionals (done automatically in the conversion from sentence-level to document-level structure)

  - Hope/Fear: *hope, fear, worry, dread*

  - Weak deontic modals
    
      - Desire: *want, prefer, would like to*
    
      - Permission: *let, permit, allow*

`NeutNeg` (neutral negative)

  - Doubt: *doubt, call into question, be dubious that, be skeptical
    that*

  - Combination of (some) <span>NeutAff</span> lexical items with negation

`PrtNeg` (partial negative)

  - Strong negative deontics: *forbid, ban, disallow*

  - Negative imperatives

  - Combination of (some) <span>PrtAff</span> lexical items with negation

`FullNeg` (full negative)

  - Negation: *not, never, no* + noun phrase

  - Negative complement taking predicates that entail that the event
    didn’t happen: *deny, prevent, prohibit, block, cease, it is
    impossible that, avoid*

  - Counterfactuals

  - Wishes: *wish*

 ## Part 5. Annotation Cheat Sheet
 
 * Sentence-level Annotation
 	* Choose the **top node** of the graph for the sentence you are annotating.
 		* If the sentence contains **one main event** (typically a lexical verb in a main clause), **annotate it** as the **top of the graph** (see [Part 3-1-1](#part-3-1-1-eventive-concepts) and [Part 3-1-3](#part-3-1-3-concept-word-mismatches) on how to decide what counts as one event).
 			* Highlight the word token that corresponds to the event. 
 			* If a citation form of it is in the lexicon already, click the "Lexicalized Concept" button and select this lemma.
 			* If it is not in the lexicon yet, click the "add to Lexicon" button and create a lexical entry for it first.
 		* If the sentence contains a **"non-verbal clause"** concept as its main event, choose the relevant **non-verbal clause predicate** as the top node (see [Part 3-1-1-3](#part-3-1-1-3-states-and-entities), [Part 3-1-3-5](#Part-3-1-3-5-Non-verbal-clauses)).
 		* If the sentence contains **multiple events** expressed in multiple clauses, decide what the top node is **based on the logical relation** between the events:
	 		* If one event is an argument of another event, choose the **main event** as the top node.
	 		* If one event is a **circumstantial participant** or **adverbial participant** in another event, choose the **main event** as the top node.
	 		* If two events are **coordinated** but a fine-grained meaning on the lowest level of the lattice in [Part 3-1-6](#part-3-1-6-discourse-relations) can be identified, choose the **main event** as the top node following the guidelines in the aforementioned section.
	 		* If two events are **coordinated** but a fine-grained meaning on the lowest level of the lattice in [Part 3-1-6](#part-3-1-6-discourse-relations) can not be identified, choose the **relevant coordinator concept** as the top node (see [Part 3-1-6](#part-3-1-6-discourse-relations)).
 			
 		
 	* Annotate the **participants** of the top node - these can be both entities and events.
 		* For each participant, select the correct **role/relation** from the "roles" drop-down menu:
 			* If the top node is an **abstract concept predicate**, use the appropriate **numbered argument roles** or **:opX** roles (see [Part 3-2-1-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-1-non-verbal-clauses) for non-verbal clause predicates, [Part 3-1-6](#part-3-1-6-discourse-relations) for discourse relations).
 			* If the top node is a **sense-disambiguated lexicalized concept** with frame files, use the relevant **numbered argument roles** (see [Part 3-1-4](#part-3-1-4-word-senses)).
 			* If the top node is a **lexical event concept without frame files**, use the relevant **general participant roles** ([Part 3-2-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-stage-0)).
 			* For **circumstantial participants** (e.g. temporal and spatial roles, conditions etc.), use the relevant **general participant roles** (see [Part 3-2-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-stage-0)).
 		* Select the correct **concept** (see [Part 3-1-3](#part-3-1-3-concept-word-mismatches) for identification of participants expressed as part of the same word of the event):
 			* If the participant is overtly expressed as a **nominal**, add the **nominal word from the sentence** to the graph.
	 			* Highlight the word token in the sentence.
	 			* Click the "Lexicalized Concept" button, and then the word token in the drop-down menu.
 			* If the participant is overtly expressed as a **verb** (e.g. complement clause, adverbial), add the **verbal word from the sentence** to the graph.
	 			* Highlight the word token in the sentence.
	 			*  If a citation form of it is in the lexicon already, click the "Lexicalized Concept" button and select this lemma.
	 			* If it is not in the lexicon yet, click the "add to Lexicon" button and create a lexical entry for it first.
 			* If the participant is expressed **pronominally**, is **impersonal**, is a **proper noun**, or is **not expressed overtly**, add the correct **named entity concept label** (e.g. _person_, _thing_, _river_ etc.) to the graph ([Part 3-1-2](#part-3-1-2-named-entities)).
	 			* If the participant's name is overt in the sentence:
		 			* Choose the correct label from the "Named Entity Types" drop-down menu
		 			* Highlight the word tokens corresponding to it and add them using the "Lexicalized Concept" button.
	 			* If the participant's name is not overt in the sentence
		 			* Choose or type the correct label in the "Abstract Concept" drop-down menu and add it using the "Add Abstract Concept" button.
 			* If the participant **has been annotated in the graph for this sentence already** (e.g. reentrancy of a main clause participant in a complement clause), select the constant for this participant in the graph and add it using the "Lexicalized Concept" button.
 			* If the participant is expressed as a **participant nominalization**, choose either of the following options:
 				* Add the word **directly from the sentence** by highlighting it and using the "Lexicalized Concept" button.
 				* Add the correct **named entity concept label** to the graph through the "Named Entity Types" or "Abstract Concept" drop-down menu and modify it with an **inverse argument role** to the relevant event concept (see [Part 3-2-1-3](#part-3-2-1-3-inverse-participant-roles)).
 		* **Repeat** these steps for every node you have added that corresponds to an **event concept**.
 	* Annote the **modifiers** of each participant.
 		* If a participant is modified by a **property concept**, either:
	 		* Annotate it with an **:ARG1-of** relation to the **have-mod-91** predicate, and complete the argument structure of this predicate (see [Part 3-2-1-1-1](#part-3-2-1-1-1-non-verbal-clauses), [Part 3-2-1-3](#part-3-2-1-3-inverse-participant-roles)).
	 		* Select the **:mod** relation from the "roles" drop-down menu, highlight the modifier word token in the sentence, and add it to the graph using the "Lexicalized Concept" button.
 		* If a participant is modified by an **event concept** (e.g. a relative clause), annotate it with an **inverse numbered or general participant role** to this event concept, and complete the argument structure of this predicate (see [Part 3-2-1-3](#part-3-2-1-3-inverse-participant-roles)).
 		* If a participant is modified by an **object concept**:
 			* Annotate it with the **:mod** relation or one of its more fine-grained sub-relations if it is a **typifying modifier** (see [Part 3-2-2](#part-3-2-2-Non-participant-role-UMR-relations)).
 			* Annotate it with the **:poss**, **:part**, or **:ARG0-of (k/ have-rel-role-92)** relations if it is an **anchoring modifier** (see [Part 3-2-2](#part-3-2-2-Non-participant-role-UMR-relations), [Part 3-2-1-3](#part-3-2-1-3-inverse-participant-roles)).
 		* If a participant is modified by a **quantifier**, annotate it with the **:quant** relation or otherwise follow the guidelines for quantification (see [Part 3-1-5](#part-3-1-5-scope-for-quantification-and-negation), [Part 3-2-2](#part-3-2-2-Non-participant-role-UMR-relations), [Part 3-3-4](#part-3-3-4-quant)).
 		* If a participant is a **named entity**, apply the **:name** and **:wiki** relations to the appropriate named entity category concept node, if you have not done so yet (see [Part 3-1-2](#part-3-1-2-named-entities)).
 	* Annotate **attributes** of participants and events.
 		* Give participants with **overt number marking** (e.g. number-marked NPs, verbal indexes with number information), a **:ref-number** attribute with the relevant value (see [Part 3-3-5](#part-3-3-5-ref)).
 		* Give **_person_ nodes** from pronouns, verbal indexation, or implicit participants - but not those corresponding to named entities - a _:ref-person_ attribute with the relevant value (see [Part 3-3-5](#part-3-3-5-ref)).
 		* Give concepts identified as **events** (see [Part 3-1-1](#part-3-1-1-eventive-concepts) for Event ID guidelines) an **:aspect** attribute with the relevant value (see [Part 3-3-1](#part-3-3-1-Aspect)).
 		* Give concepts identified as **events** (see [Part 3-1-1](#part-3-1-1-eventive-concepts) for Event ID guidelines) the relevant **modal attributes** ([Part 4-3](#part-4-3-modal-dependency)):
	 		* Give events **under the scope of a modal event** (e.g. a wanting-event) a **:modpred** relation with the space-building complement-taking predicate as the parent.
	 		* Give events **under the scope of a reporting event** a **:quot** relation with the reporting verb as the parent, and a **:modstr** relation with the relevant strenght.
	 		* Give **all other events** a **:modstr** annotation with the relevant strength.
 		* For **interrogative, imperative,** or **expressive** clauses, give the main verb a **:mode** attribute with the relevant value (see [Part 3-3-2](#part-3-3-2-mode)).
 		* Give constituents that are **morphosyntactically negated** or verbs in **polar questions** a **:polarity** attribute with the relevant value (see [Part 3-3-3](#part-3-3-3-polarity)).
 		* Give concepts that are modified with a **downtoner** or **intensifier** a **:degree** attribute with the relevant value ([Part 3-3-6](#part-3-3-6-degree)).
 
 * Document-level Annotation
 	* For any **event concept** or **object concept**:
 		* Assess whether it is **coreferential** with a previously mentioned event or object concept. In the case of object concepts, also assess whether it is a **subset** of another concept.
 		* If so, choose the relevant **coreference relation**, with the previous mention as the head and the current mention as the child (see [Part 4-1](#part-4-1-coreference)).
 	* Assess  the **modal dependency structure** generated on the basis of the sentence-level modal annotation.
	 	* Edit any errors.
	 	* If possible, substitute the relevant modal strength value for any **:Unsp** links generated between conceivers and events because of **:modpred** relations in the sentence-level annotation.
 	* Give every concept **identified as an event** (see [Part 3-1-1](#part-3-1-1-eventive-concepts) for Event ID guidelines) and each **time expression** in the text a temporal annotation (see [Part 4-2](#part-4-2-temporal-dependency)).
